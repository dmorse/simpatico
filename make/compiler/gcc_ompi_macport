# -- Settings for Mac OS X + Open-MPI, Open-MPI Installed by MacPorts --

# These settings are designed to work for code that is compiled on Mac
# OS X using the gcc compiler and a copy of the Open-MPI library that 
# was installed  using the MacPort package manager. The MacPort manager 
# places header and  library files in non-standard locations within 
# the /opt/local directory tree, and these locations do not seem to be 
# found by the mpicxx script created by using MacPort to install 
# open-mpi. We found that this required us to add some explicit search 
# paths to the variables INCLUDES and LDFLAGS used by the compiler and 
# linker recipes.

# --------------------------------------------
# Miscellaneous definitions

# Search path for C++ header files (must include src/ directory)
# Includes location of open-mpi header (*.h) files
INCLUDES= -I$(SRC_DIR)
INCLUDES+= -I/opt/local/include/openmpi-mp

# Compiler option to specify ANSI C++ standard
ifdef UTIL_CXX11
   CXX_STD = --std=c++11
else
   CXX_STD = --std=c++98
endif

# --------------------------------------------
# Compiler used for serial programs 

# Serial C++ compiler command
CXX_SER= g++

# Flags passed when debugging is enabled
CXXFLAGS_SER_DEBUG= -Wall $(CXX_STD)

# Flags passed when debugging is disabled (production code)
CXXFLAGS_SER_FAST= -Wall $(CXX_STD) -O3 -ffast-math -Winline

# Compiler flags used in unit tests
TESTFLAGS= -Wall $(CXX_STD)

# --------------------------------------------
# Compiler and execution for parallel programs 

# Parallel MPI C++ compiler command (or wrapper script)
CXX_PAR=mpicxx

# Flags passed to compiler when debugging is enabled
CXXFLAGS_PAR_DEBUG= -Wall $(CXX_STD)

# Flags passed when debugging is disabled (production code)

# MPI execution command (followed by integer number of processors)
MPIRUN=mpirun -np

# --------------------------------------------
# Linker / Loader 

# Flags passed to compiler for linking and loading
# Contains a search path and names for MPI library files. 
LDFLAGS= -L/opt/local/lib/openmpi-mp -lmpi_cxx -lmpi

# --------------------------------------------
# Archiver

# Library archiver command (for creating static libraries)
AR=ar

# Flags (command line options) passed to archiver
