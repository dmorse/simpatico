This directory contains repository versions of configuration files
that are copied to appropriate locations in the standard build
directories (src/, bld/serial and bld/parallel) by the setup script.
Users may modify the copies that are installed in the src and bld
directories, but should avoid modifying these default versions.

Main makefile in src/, bld/serial and bld/parallel:

The files main_config.1 and main_config.2 are fragments of the main
configuration file. These two files are concatenated with a compiler 
setup file from the make/compiler directory to create the main config.mk
configuration file that is installed in the src/ directory and the 
root of each build directory. 

Namespace level makefiles:

The files util_config, simp_config, mcMd_config, tools_config and 
ddMd_config are repository versions of namespace level configuration 
files, which are copied to create files named config.mk in each 
corresponding namespace level subdirectory.
