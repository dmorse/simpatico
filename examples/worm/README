All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
wormlike chains of 8 atoms. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs
that have been compiled with angle potentials enabled. These
 created by cd'ing to bld/parallel, for parallel programs, 
or bld/serial, for serial programs, and entering

> ./configure -a1 

before recompiling. The examples will also run with programs
in which other optional features (e.g., dihedrals or external
potentials) have also been enabled.
