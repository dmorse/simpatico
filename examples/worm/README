All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
wormlike chains of 8 atoms. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs
that have been compiled with angle potentials enabled. These
 created by cd'ing to bld/parallel, for parallel programs, or 
bld/serial, for serial programs, and entering

> ./configure -a1 

before recompiling. To compile in source (i.e., within the
src/ directory) enter the same command from that directory
before recompiling. The names of the resulting executables
(installed in simpatico/bin by default) should include a
"_a" suffix to indicate that angles have been enabled, giving,
e.g., mcSim_a or ddSim_a.  The examples will also run with 
programs in which other optional features (e.g., dihedrals 
or external potentials) have also been enabled at compile
time, though not invoked in the parameter file for this
example.
