Simpatico is a C++ package for Molecular Dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), 
and hybrid MC simulations of classical mechanical models of polymeric and
molecular liquids. It contains:

- A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.

- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
  simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

The parallel MD program ddSim uses a spatial domain decomposition for 
parallelization.
   
Getting the Source Code:
------------------------

Simpatico source code may be obtained by using git to clone the github repository 
from the repository page
                                                                             
<https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico>.

Use the command

git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico.git

The --recursive option is necessary to clone some git submodules that are 
maintained in separate repositories. 

Documentation:
--------------

Web pages that provide both user and developer documentation for 
Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen utility (www.doxygen.org).  
Doxygen creates html web pages that are deposited in the directory 
doc/html/ of the working tree. These pages are created from comments 
extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set of text files in the 
directory doc/manual/. These text files, which have the file extension 
*.dox, contain the text for a set of introductory documentation pages, 
and are readable in any text editor. 

A recent copy of the documentation is available online, at

<http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html>.

After getting a copy of the source code (either by download or by 
cloning the git repository), you can use dOxygen to generate a local 
copy of the html documentation within the simpatico/doc/html directory 
of the source code tree.  This requires that dOxygen be installed on 
your computer and that the executable be in a directory in your PATH. 
The basic instructions (after dOxygen is installed) are:

  - cd to the simpatico/doc directory

  - Enter "make html"

This should create many html files in the simpatico/doc/html 
directory. To begin reading the documentation, point a browser at 
the file simpatico/doc/html/index.html, which is the main page.

Compiling:
----------

The code is ansi standard C++ and must be compiled from source. 
Multi-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions of 
mcSim and mdSim) also require an MPI library. The build system 
requires the gnu version of the unix make utility and a python
interpreter.

Complete instructions for compiling various versions of Simpatico 
are given in the text file simpatico/doc/manual/user/compile.dox, 
or in the corresponding html web page in the doc/html directory.
Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor 
versions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:

- Add the simpatico/bin directory to your linux command search
  PATH environment variable, and add the simpatico/scripts/python 
  directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

- cd to the simpatico/ root directory

- Enter "./setup" from this root directory to run a setup script

- Enter "make mcMd" from the same directory

The resulting executables, named "mcSim" and "mdSim", will be 
installed in the simpatico bin/ directory. Please see the text 
file and html documentation mentioned above for further 
instructions for compiling multi-processor programs, which may 
require modification of the users programming environment and/or 
simpatico configuration files to provide access to an MPI 
library.  

Instructions for enabling or disabling a variety of optional 
compile-time features are also given in the html documentation.
