System:

    melt of 100 flexible homopolymer chains of 8 atoms.

=======================================================
Usage (with run script):
   
    From this directory, invoke:

    > ./run MODE

    where MODE is a string that can be nve or nvt.

    This runs and then restarts a simulation using the 
    parameter file param.MODE, the command file "command",
    and the restart command file "commrst". Outputs of
    the original simulation are placed in directory out/,
    outputs of the restarted simulation are place in
    directory rst/.

    To remove all files generated by such a run, invoke

    > ./clean

=======================================================
Usage (directly calling mdSim):

NVE MD simulation:

    mdSim -e -p param.nve -c commands

NVT MD simulation

    mdSim -e -p param.nvt -c commands

NVT DPD simulation

    mdSim -e -p param.dpd -c commands

Restarting NVE or NVT MD simulations

    mdSim -e -r restart -c commands.rst
