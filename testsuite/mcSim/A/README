Description:

    MC simulation of homopolymer melt.
    M=100 flexible homopolymer chains of N=8 atoms.
    WCA and Harmonic potentials. Combination of MC moves.

Usage:

Use run script to run and restart:

    ./run

    Places outputs of original run in out/, and of restart in rst/

To manually run an MC simulation:

    mcSim -e -p param.nve -c command

To manually restart the above simulation:

    mcSim -e -r restart -c commrst -o rst/

Cleaning up (empties out/ and rst/ directories)

    ./clean
