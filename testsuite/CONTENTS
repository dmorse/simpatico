Each subdirectory of testsuite/ contains a directory of one or
more tests for a specific program (mcSim, mdSim, etc.), indicated by 
the name of the executable. Directories mcSim_m/ and mdSim_m/ contain
tests for the MPI multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim, for
which the default executable file names are mcSim_m and mdSim_m.
