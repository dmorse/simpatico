# This makefile file defines:
#
#   - A variable $(INTER_DEFS) that is passed to the processor to define 
#     preprocessor flags that effect the code in the mcMd/ directory. 
#
#   - A variable $(INTER_SUFFIX) which is added as a suffix to the name
#     of the inter library.
#
#   - The name $(INTER_LIB) of the inter library file.
#
# This file is included by every makefile in the inter directory, and in 
# directories containing source code that depends on the Inter namespace.
# It should be included after $(SRC_DIR)/config.mk and before
# $(SRC_DIR)/inter/patterns.mk.

# Makefile variables to define preprocessor macros that enable/disable
# potential energy contributions.

# Define INTER_NOPAIR, disable non-bonded pair potentials 
#INTER_NOPAIR=1

# Define INTER_BOND, enable 2-body bond potentials

# Define INTER_ANGLE, enable 3-body angle potentials

# Define INTER_DIHEDRAL, enable 4-body dihedral torsion potentials
#INTER_DIHEDRAL=1

# Define INTER_COULOMB, enable Coulomb potentials
#INTER_COULOMB=1

# Define INTER_EXTERNAL, enable external potentials

# The following code defines the variables INTER_DEFS and INTER_SUFFIX.
#
# The variable INTER_DEFS is used to pass preprocessor definitions to
# the compiler, using the "-D" compiler option. If not empty, it must 
# consist of a list of zero or more preprocessor macro names, each 
# preceded by the compiler flag "-D".  For example, setting INTER_DEFS 
# to "-DINTER_ANGLE -DINTER_DIHEDRAL" will cause compilation of a version 
# of the code with angle and dihedral potentials enabled.
#
# The variable INTER_SUFFIX is appended to the base names of the library 
# mcMd.a in the $(LIB_DIR) directory. It is also added to the mcMd library
# and to the executables mcSim, mdSim, and ddSim in the $(BIN_DIR). If no
# other features were enabled, setting INTER_SUFFIX to "_a", to denote a 
# version with angular potentials enabled, would lead to creation of a 
# library file named inter_a.a in the directory $(SRC_DIR)/inter and 
# executables named mcSim_a and mdSim_a. 
 
INTER_DEFS=
INTER_SUFFIX:=

# The variable INTER_DEFS is a recursive (normal) makefile variable, and
# may be extended using the += operator, e.g., INTER_DEFS+=-DINTER_ANGLE.
# The INTER_SUFFIX is a non-recursive makefile variable, which may be 
# extended using the := operator, as INTER_SUFFIX:=$(INTER_SUFFIX)_a. 
# They are defined differently because the += operator adds a white space
# before an added string, which is appropriate for INTER_DEFS, but not for 
# INTER_SUFFIX. 
#
# Each if block in what follows contains two lines: The first adds a 
# string containing a preprocessor macro to INTER_DEFS. The second adds
# an underscore and a string of one or two identifying letters to 
# INTER_SUFFIX. The addition of suffixes to the library and executable
# names is optional, and may be suppressed by commenting out the relevant 
# lines.
#
# See the file src/mcMd/dox/preprocessor.dox for an explanation of all
# of preprocessor macros listed below.
