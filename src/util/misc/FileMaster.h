   /**
   * A FileMaster manages a set of input and output files.
   *
   * A FileMaster manages a set of input and output files in which
   * all input file paths share a common input prefix and all output
   * file paths share a common output prefix.  The openInputFile() 
   * and openOutputFile() methods each open a file using a path 
   * that is constructed by a prefix to a base filename that is
   * passed to the function as a parameter, using different prefixes
   * for input and output files.  A FileMaster also provides access 
   * to a separate parameter file.
   *
   * The paths constructed by a FileMaster are made by concatenating
   * elements that may include any of the following (presented in the
   * order they appear:
   *
   *  - An optional root prefix, which is the path from the current
   *    working directory to the root level directory for input and 
   *    output files for this run. The root prefix defaults to an 
   *    empty string, and may be set by the setRootPrefix method. 
   *    If it is set, the root prefix should end with a "/" directory 
   *    separator. 
   *
   *  - In MPI simulations of multiple systems, filenames may contain
   *    a directory id prefix of the form "p/", where p is an integer
   *    id that identifies a system. The integer directory id may be
   *    set with the setDirectoryId(int id) method. A directory id 
   *    is added to paths only if a directory id has been set. 
   *
   *  - Input files opened by the openInputFile() method and output 
   *    files opened by the openOutputFile() method contain an 
   *    inputPrefix or outputPrefix string, respectively. The 
   *    inputPrefix and outputPrefix strings are read from the
   *    parameter file by the readParam method.
   *
   * The paths to input and output files opened by the openInputFile()
   * and openOutputFile() methods are constructed by concatenating the
   * optional rootPrefix (if any), the optional directory id string
   * (if any), the inputPrefix or outputPrefix string, and a base name
   * that is passed explicitly to the method. 
   *
   * To put all input and output files for a given system in different
   * directories, the input and output prefix strings should be set to
   * the names of the desired directory names, followed by a trailing
   * "/" directory separator.  For example, to put all input and 
   * output files in directories named "in" and "out", these prefix 
   * strings should be set to "in/" and "out/", respectively.
   * 
   * The setDirectoryId(int rank) method is designed for use in parallel
   * MPI programs, to allow files associated with different systems to
   * be put in different directory trees. If this method is called with
   * an 3, while using input and output prefixes "in/" and "out/" and 
   * no overall rootPrefix, the openInputFile() and openOutputFile() 
   * functions will open all input and output files in directories 
   * "3/in" and "3/out", respectively.
   *
   * The paramFile() method returns a default parameter input stream.
   * If no directory id has been set, as is normally the case for
   * simulations of a single system, paramFile() returns a reference 
   * to the standard input, std::cin.  If a directory id has been set
   * and setParamFileStdIn() has also been called, paramFile() again 
   * returns a reference to std::cin. If a directory id has been set 
   * and setParamFileStdIn() has not be called, however, paramFile() 
   * returns a reference to a file named "n/param" for a processor
   * with directoryId == n. If a rootPrefix has been set, the root 
   * prefix is prepended to the path "n/param". This file is opened
   * for reading the first time it is returned by paramFile(), and 
   * is closed by the FileMaster destructor.
   *
   * The class also provides methods to open a command file, and 
   * parameter and restart input and output files that are used for
   * restarting a simulation. The paths to each of these files are
   * constructed as a concatenation of a root prefix (if any), a
   * directory id string (if any), and a base name provided as a
   * parameter to these methods.
