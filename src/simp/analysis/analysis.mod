* This module contains a collection of "mix-in" classes that
* can be used to construct analyzer classes in namespaces that
* depend on the Simp namespace (e.g., McMd and DdMd). Analyzer
* classes should inherit from both the analyzer base class in
* the enclosing namespace, which defines the public interface
* used by the simulation program, and from an associated "mixin"
* class, which defines common algorithms and output formats.
