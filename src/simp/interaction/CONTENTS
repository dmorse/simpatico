The classes in subdirectories of src/simp/interaction define potential 
energy functions (interactions) for individual nonbonded-pairs, bonds, 
angles, etc.  These are used by both the single-processor programs in 
src/mcMd and the parallel MD program in ddMd/.


Subdirectories:
---------------

pair           non-bonded pair interactions
bond           covalent bond interactions
angle          covalent angle (3-body) interactions
dihedral       covalent dihedral (4-body) interactions
external       external 1-body interactions
