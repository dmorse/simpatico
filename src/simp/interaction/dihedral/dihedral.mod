   * \brief    Potential functions for covalent dihedral interactions.
   *
   * Dihedral potentials are usually expressed as functions of a dihedral
   * torsion angle, \f$ \phi \f$. Dihedral interactions may use instances 
   * of Torsion and TorsionForce to calculate the dihedral angle and its
   * derivatives. The dihedral angle is defined in these classes as follows:
   *
   * Consider 4 sequential atoms with position vectors \f$ {\bf r}_{i} \f$ 
   * labelled sequentially by an index i = 0, 1, 2, 3. We define three bond 
   * vectors
   * \f[
   *   {\bf b}_i = {\bf r}_i - {\bf r}_{i-1}
   * \f]
   * for i = 1, 2, 3. The dihedral angle is an angle between the plane 
   * spanned by bond vectors 1 and 2 and the plane spanned by bond vectors 
   * 2 and 3. Define two vectors 
   * \f[ 
   *      {\bf v}_{1} = {\bf b}_1 \times {\bf b}_2 
   *      \quad\quad 
   *      {\bf v}_{2} = {\bf b}_2 \times {\bf b}_3 
   * \f]
   * perpendicular to these planes, and corresponding unit vectors 
   * \f[ 
   *     {\bf u}_1 = {\bf v}_{1}/|{\bf v}_{1}|  
   *     \quad\quad 
   *     {\bf u}_2 = {\bf v}_{2}/|{\bf v}_{2}|  
   * \f] 
   * The cosine of the dihedral angle is given by the dot product:
   * \f[
   *    \cos(\phi) \equiv {\bf u}_1 \cdot {\bf u}_2
   * \f]
   * With this convention, a planar sys (arc) conformation yields 
   * phi = 0, and a planar anti/trans (zig-zag) conformation yields 
   * phi = 180 degrees.
