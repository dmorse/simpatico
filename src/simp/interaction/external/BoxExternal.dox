The BoxExternal interaction implements a repulsive 9-3 confining potential
along the walls of an orthorhombic box, in all three directions. For each
Cartesian direction i=0, 1, or 2 for which the box dimension is L[i], the
interaction creates a repulsive potential centered around x[i] = 0 or
x = L[i], thus confining x[i] to the domain 0 < x[i] < L[i].  The form of
the potential in each direction is the same as that used in the 
one-dimensional SliExternal potential, which confines particles only in
the z (i=2) direction. 

The parameter file format is the same as for BoxExternal:
\code
   epsilon    float
   sigma      float
   cutoff     float
\endcode
As in BoxExternal, the parameter \f$\rho\f$ has a hard-coded default 
value of \f$\rho \equiv 0.7\f$.
