The SlitExternal interaction implements a repulsive 9-3 confining potential
in which confining forces act only along the z/2 direction. In a boundary
of length \f$L\f$ in the \f$z\f$ direction, the potential confines particles 
to the domain \f$0 < z < L\f$ by putting repulsive walls as \f$z = 0\f$ and 
\f$z = L\f$. Let d be the shortest distance to these walls, given by 
the lesser of z and L - z. The potential energy is a function of d, and is
given by
\f[
   V(d) = \frac{4\pi \epsilon \rho\sigma^{3}} {45}
          \left ( \frac{\sigma^{9}}{d^{9}} - 7.5 \frac{\sigma^{9}}{d^{9}}
                  + \frac{25}{\sqrt{10}}
          \right)
\f]
for \f$ d_{i} < d < d_{c} \f$, where \f$ d_{i} = 0.506079 \sigma \f$, and 
where \f$ d_{c} \f$ is a user provided cutoff. For \f$ d > d_{c} \f$, the
potential and force both vanish: \f$ V(d) = 0 \f$. 
For \f$ d < d_{i} \f$, \f$ V(d) = V(d_{i}) \f$, and the force vanishes.
  
The parameter file format for SlitExternal is
\code
   epsilon             float
   sigma               float
   cutoff              float
\endcode
The parameter \f$\rho\f$ has a hard-coded default value of 
\f$\rho \equiv 0.7\f$.
