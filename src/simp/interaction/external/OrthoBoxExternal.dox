The OrthoBoxExternal interaction implements a repulsive 9-3 confining 
potential that confines particles in one or more direction.  For each 
Cartesian direction i=0, 1, or 2 for which i is greater than or equal 
to a user provided integer indexConfinement, the interaction creates 
a repulsive potential centered around x[i] = 0 or x = L[i], thus 
confining x[i] to the domain 0 < x[i] < L[i].  
Setting indexConfinement = 0 thus confines the particles in all three 
directions, indexConfinement = 1 confines the particles in the y and z 
direction, and indexConfinement = 2 confines the particles only in the z
direction. The form of the potential in each direction is the same as 
that used in the one-dimensional SlitExternal potential, which confines 
particles only in the z (i=2) direction. 

The parameter file format is:
\code
   indexConfinement   integer
   epsilon            float
   sigma              float
   cutoff             float
\endcode
As in SlitExternal, the parameter \f$\rho\f$ has a hard-coded default 
value of \f$\rho \equiv 0.7\f$.
