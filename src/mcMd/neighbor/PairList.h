   /**
   * A Verlet neighbor list.
   *
   * A PairList (or Verlet list) is a list of neighboring pairs of Atoms that 
   * are separated by a distance less than a specified cutoff. The cutoff for
   * the Verlet list is the sum of a potential cutoff, which is passed as a 
   * parameter to allocate(), and a "skin", which is read by readParameters().
   *
   * After a PairList is constructed, the allocate() method must be called to
   * allocate memory for both the data structures required to store the PairList
   * and for a private CellList object that is used to construct the PairList.
   *
   * To build or rebuild a PairList, after it has been allocated, one must 
   * invoke clear() to clear the private CellList, call addAtom(Atom&) once for
   * every atom in the System, within a loop over atoms,  and then call build() 
   * to actually construct the PairList. The addAtom() method adds an Atom to
   * an internal CellList, and then build() uses the CellList to build a list
   * of pairs. Atomic positions must not be changed during this process.
   *
   * A PairIterator object must be used to iterate over all of the pairs in a 
   * completed PairList (see documentation for PairIterator for usage).
   *
   * A completed PairList is guaranteed to remain valid as long as no Atom 
   * in the system has moved more than a distance skin/2 from its position 
   * when the PairList was last built. The method isCurrent() determines if 
   * this criterion is satisfied, by comparing current atomic positions to
   * positions that were stored when the PairList was last built. In an MD
   * simulation, isCurrent() should be called after every time step, and 
   * the PairList should be rebuilt if its return value is false.

      * Implementation Notes:
      *
      * The pair list is stored in Atom* pointer arrays atom1Ptrs_, atom2Ptrs_, 
      * and in an integer array first_. Each element of atom1Ptrs_ contains a 
      * pointer to the first atom in a pair (the primary Atom). Each element 
      * of atom2Ptrs_ contains a pointer to the second atom in a pair (the 
      * secondary Atom).  Secondary atoms that are neighbors of the same 
      * primary atom are listed consecutively.  Element first_[i] contains the 
      * array index of the first element in atom2Ptrs_ that contains a neighbor 
      * of primary atom atom1Ptrs_[i]. Pointers to neighbors of primary atom
      * *atom1Ptrs_[i] are thus stored in elements first_[i] <= j < first_[i+1]
      * of atom2Ptrs_.  Each pair is included only once, by including only 
      * pairs in which atom2Ptrs_[j]->id() > atom1Ptrs_[i]->id(), so
      * the Id of the secondary atom in a pair is always greater than that of
      * the primary atom.  The total number of primary atoms in atom1Ptrs_ is 
      * nAtom1_. The total number of secondary atoms in Array atom2Ptrs_ (or 
      * the total number of distinct pairs) is nAtom2_. The total number of
      * Atoms in the System in nAtom_.
      *
      * The only way legal way to loop over all atom pairs, using the public 
      * interface of a PairList, is to use a PairListIterator. See the 
      * documentation of PairListIterator for a discussion of its usage. The 
      * resulting loop over pairs is equivalent to the following double loop 
      * over private member variables of PairList:
      * 
      *    int i, j;
      *    Atom* atom1Ptr;
      *    Atom* atom2Ptr;
      *
      *    \\ Loop over primary Atoms
      *    for (i = 0; i < nAtom1_; ++i) {
      *       atom1Ptr = atom1Ptrs_[i];
      *
      *       // Loop over secondary atoms
      *       for (j = first_[i]; j < first_[i+1]; ++j) {
      *           atom2Ptr = atom2Ptrs_[j];
      *
      *           // ... Do something with Atoms *atom1Ptr and *atom2Ptr.
      *
      *       }
      *    }
      *
      * Note that DArray<int> first_ contains nAtom1_ + 1 elements. The first
      * element, element first_[0] is equal to 0, and the last element,
      * first_[nAtom1_], is always equal to nAtom2_, the total number of 
      * pairs.
      *
      * The number of primary Atoms nAtom1_ is generally less than nAtom_, the 
      * total number of atoms, because some Atoms have no neighbors with integer
      * Ids higher than their own. This is always true, for example, for the
      * Atom with the highest Id. Pointers to such atoms, which do not appear
      * in the first nAtom1_ elements of atom1Ptrs_, are instead stored  in the
      * last elements of the atom1Ptrs_ array , in elements tList1 + 1, .... ,
      * atomCapacity_ - 1. The previous position Vectors for these Atoms are 
      * stored in the corresponding elements of the oldPositions_ array. 
      * These pointers and previous positions retained because they are used 
      * in the isCurrent() method to calculate how far these Atoms have moved 
      * since the last time the PairList was built.
