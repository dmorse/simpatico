   * ConfigIo for Lammps data files.
   *
   * This class reads and writes the data file format that is read
   * by the LAMMPS read_data command.  Because the Lammps data model
   * is very different than that used in Simpatico, there are 
   * signficant restrictions on the use of such files:
   *
   * 1) When reading a LAMMPS data file, the maximum total number of
   * atoms defined by the Simpatico parameter file must exactly match
   * the number of atoms in the data file.
   *
   * 2) The atom ids (or tags) in the Lammps data file must appear in 
   * order, numbered from 1.  This is checked. 
   *
   * 3) The ordering of atoms in the lammps file and the topology are
   * assumed to be consistent with that used in Simpatico. The topology
   * information in the Lammps data file is discarded. This requires
   * that atoms within each molecule be listed sequentially, with
   * molecules with the same species listed sequentially, and that
   * ordered of atoms within each molecule be consistent with the
   * numbering scheme used in Simpatico. Thus far, none of this is 
   * checked.
