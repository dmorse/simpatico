   /**
   * Replica exchange Monte Carlo move using Gibbs sampling
   *
   * This class implements a rather general form of the algorithm for a 
   * replica exchange / parallel tempering move.  The algorithm assumes that 
   * the Boltzmann weight W(X,p) for a system in configuration X depends upon 
   * some floating point parameter p in a manner that is described by an
   * Perturbation object associated with the parent System.  The ReplicaMove 
   * constructor requires a parent System as a parameter, and requires that 
   * the System has an associated Perturbation object when the ReplicaMove
   * is constructed.
   *
   * This move implements a version replica exchange that uses the Gibbs sampler
   * technique to sample permutations in replica space from the corresponding
   * distribution.  The sampling is done by running a small (inexpensive)
   * Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of \b nSamling steps at every replica
   * exchange step, at the end of which a permutation is obtained that is used
   * to swap configurations between replicas. This implies that all
   * configurations are permuted simultaneously (but there may be
   * configurations which stay on the same processor).
   *
   * The technique is described in detail in
   * John D. Chodera and Michael R. Shirts, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 194110 (2011)
