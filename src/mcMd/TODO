AtomType
--------

  - Add static bool atomHaveDiameters_ and non-static double diameter_ members

  - Make Simulation a friend of AtomType

  - Add optional atomHaveDiameters_ parameter in Simulation::readParameters

  - Optionally read and write diameter_ members. Initialize to 1.0 by default.

Generator
---------

  - Add CellList to Generator base class, and method to test proximity to
    existing atoms.

  - Allow user to pass a scale parameter to generate() method. Positions
    that are greater than scale x additive diameter from all other are
    accepted.

  - Use explicit dynamic casting to determine which private generation 
    function to call within the generate() method. 

  - Write specialized generator for Point molecules

  - Rewrite the function for Linear Molecules

Species
-------

- Replace Species generator method by non-member function template with 
  explicit specializations for Linear and Atom.

- Move Species, SpeciesGroup etc. to a new Chem namespace, so it can be 
  used in Tool namespace.

Cfb Moves
----------

- Fix CfbEndBase to work correctly with angles. Add sign parameter to add
  and remove functions. 

- Fix CfbReptation to work with angles

ConfigIos
---------

- Modify LammpsConfigIo to allow writing of angles and dihedrals, as needed.

Serialization
-------------

- Test save / load with perturbation
- Test save / load with replica move
- Test MD serialization after forcing pair list rebuild upon restart output
- Move restart interval and file name, and isInitialized_  to Simulation base 
  classs.

Constant Pressure MD 
--------------------

- Port and test NptIntegrator subclass from DdMd.

Non-Orthorhombic (Rigid) Boundaries
-----------------------------------

- Use new applyShift method in MSD analyzer classes.

- Find other uses of Boundary::lengths in McMd namespace.
  Add tests to cause crash before misuse, as needed.

- Add Boundary::isOrthorhombic test other classes that require 
  orthorhombic boundaries.

- Add tests for CellList specifically for Monoclinic Boundary.

- Make an example in a Monoclinic cell and try running it with 
  mdSim and mcSim.

Deformable Boundaries
---------------------

- Generalize snapshot and obsolete pair list methods to use 
  miniminumDeformRatio to deal optimally with MD in deforming boundaries.

Perturbation
------------

- Modify so that perturbation can be used without MPI, or change conditional 
  compilation so that a perturbation can only be compiled ifdef UTIL_MPI.

Interactions (Design change):
-----------------------------

- Make Interaction classes apply to only one choice of type index / indices.
  PotentialImpl class templates would then hold an array of Interactions.

- Create << and >> operators for each Interaction class. 

- Change file format to read typeId (ids) << Interaction.

SystemAccess base classes
-------------------------

- Rename SubSystem SystemAccess
- Define (Mc|Md)SystemAccess classes with potential energy accessors
- Derive analyzers from a public Analyzer and a protected (Mc|Md)SystemAccess
- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in analyzers
- Derive SystemMcMove from a protected McSystemAccess
- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in mcMoves
- Derive MdIntegrator from a protected MdSystemAccess
- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in mdIntegrators
