The src/modules directory is intended as a place for users to add 
"modules" of code that extend the capabilities of mcSim and/or mdSim
for a specific application. Each subdirectory of src/modules should 
contain the source code for a single such module and should have a 
subdirectory name which is the name of the module. 

A module named "stuff" in subdirectory src/mcMd/modules/stuff must 
contain a makefile fragment named src/mcMd/modules/stuff/sources.mk
that defines a makefile variable mcMd_modules_stuff_ that expands to 
a list of all of the *.cpp source files in that module, with paths
defined relative to the simpatico/src/ directory. 

To enable the simpatico makefile system to compile the source
files in a module, the user must make some small modifications
of the user file src/mcMd/modules/sources.mk. Instructions for
doing so are given in the repository version of the file, named 
src/mcMd/modules/sources.mk_r.

The modules/sliplink directory contains an example of a complete 
module. The file src/mcMd/modules/sources.mk_r contains commented
out lines that would be required to enable compilation of this
module.  This particular module contains code that was added to
simpatico to allow it to be used for Monte Carlo simulations of
a coarse-grained model of entangled chains in which entanglements
were modelled by mobile links between chains, and can only be 
compiled when the MCMC_LINK makefile variable is defined.

Module C++ Source Files
-----------------------

Every module must contain header and source code files to define
the following types of classes:

  - A set of "feature" classes, each of which is a subclass of
    one of the McMd base classes such Analyzer or McMove, each
    of which adds a feature to mcSim and/or mdSim.

  - A corresponding set of one or more "factory" classes that 
    can create instances of the feature classes.

Each factory class in a module is a subclass of the Factory 
class associated with a given base class. For example, a module
that contains one or more subclasses of McMd::Analyzer must 
also have factory class that is a subclass of Factory<Analyzer>.
The implementation of the factory() member function of each such 
factory class must be able to create an instance of any of the 
"feature" classes of the appropriate type. By convention, the 
name of each factory class should start with the name of the 
module. Thus for example, the factory in the sliplink module 
that creates McMove objects is called SliplinkMcMoveFactory.

Complicated modules may also contain one or two "module" 
classes. A module class is a simple class that encapsulates 
the code that must be added to the main simulation program
in order to allow the associated classes to be used in a 
simulation. By convention, a Module class should have an
instance of each associated factory class as a member 
variable. The constructor of a module should take an
MdSimulation or McSimulation object as an argument, and 
should invoke the "addSubfactory" functions required to 
add the specialized subfactories defined in the module as 
subfactories of the corresponding factory objects used by
the main simulation object. To enable use of a module, the
user must simply include the header file for such a module 
class in the main mcSim and/or mdSim program and add a line 
to the main program that creates an instannce of the 
module class. 

Module Makefiles
----------------

Each module must contain makefile fragments named sources.mk 
that should be designed to allow the code to be compiled along 
with the rest of the simpatico source code, and that allow the
resulting object files to be archived in the mcMdlib.a library 
file. All makefiles and sources.mk files in a module that is
defined in a subdirectory of mcMd/modules should have the same
structure as those used throughout the simpoatico src/ 
repository. Thus, for example, a module named "stuff" that is
located in directory src/mcMd/modules/stuff should define a
makefile variable named mcMd_modules_stuff_ that expands to a
list of all of the *.cpp source code files in the module. 

In order to allow the classes in a module to be compiled along
with the simpatico source code, the user must modify the file
src/mcMd/modules/sources.mk file to as to add the module to
the simpatico makefile system. For example, to enable a module
located in src/mcMd/modules/stuff, one would add a line to 
modules/sources.mk file that includes the module sources.mk
file, src/mcMd/modules/stuff/sources.mk, and modify the 
definition of the variable mcMd_modules_ so as to add the
value of mcMd_modules_stuff_ to the end of mcMd_modules_. 

Summary:
--------

To enable use of a module, a user must:

  - Add a subdirectory to the src/mcMd/modules directory 
    containing the source code for the module. 

  - Modify the src/mcMd/modules/sources.mk file, as described above,
    to allow the module to be compiled along with the rest of the
    simpatico source code. 

  - Modify the main MC program src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp and/or the main
    MD program src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp to allow the module to be used
    in the main program. 

If a module defines a module class, the main program must be 
modified by adding a line to include the header file for the 
appropriate module and adding a line to the main program that
constructs an instance of that module. The code in the module
class constructor should then make the factory classes that
are defined in the module accessible for use at run time.
