\section mcMd_analyzer_StructureFactorGrid_overview_sec Synopsis

This analyzer calculates the structure factor for all wavevectors within
a grid, for all integer wavevector indices up to some maximum value. It also groups together values from "stars" of wavevectors that are related by symmetry, such as the {100} family of 6 wavevectors, and outputs a single average value for the entire star.

The McMd::StructureFactorGrid class is a subsclass of McMd::StructureFactor. Like McMd::StructureFactor, it calculates the structure factor at a set of wavevectors, using a specified set of "modes" for each wavevector. The difference is that StructureFactorGrid generates all wavevectors on a grid, and then outputs results in a manner that averages over wavevectors that are related by symmetry. See the documentation of McMd::StructureFactor for an explanation of the concept of "modes", and the parameter file format for specifying modes.

\section mcMd_analyzer_StructureFactorGrid_out_sec Output Files

Final values are output to {outputFileName}.data. Each row is a star of symmetry related reciprocal lattice vectors, each column is a mode.
