TODO:

Documentation (need *.dox files):

   system/LinearRouseAutoCorr 
   system/RingRouseAutoCorr 

Reimplement as subclasses of existing base classes:

   system/BlockRadiusGyration (also rename BlockRadiusGyrationSq )
   system/BoundaryAverage (rename OrthoBoundaryAnalyzer)

Rename / Rewrite:

   mcSystem/McNVTChemicalPotential -> LinFlexMuAnalyzer
   mcSystem/McMuExchange -> McMuExchangeAnalyzer (rewrite)

   mcSystem/McPairEnergyAverage -> McPairEnergyAnalyzer

   Retest, reconsider and use PairEnergyCoefficients

   Replace MdVirialStressTensorAverage with MdStressAnalyzer

Serialization:
 
 - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

 - Test that all analyzers restart, preferably tested within the 
   testsuite/ tests.

Analyzers not used in any McMd testsuite:

   BlockRadiusAverage (need diblock test)
   BoundaryAverage (need npt mcSim test)
   CompositionProfile (need diblock lamellar with external potential)
   ClusterHistogram (need test with clusters)

New analyzers:

 - AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle (McMd and DdMD)
 - mcSystem/McPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 
 - mcSystem/MdPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 

More Generic Base Classes:

   AutoCorrelation(Analyzer|Mixin)<class T>
   MeanSqDisplacement(Analyzer|Mixin)<class T>

Reorganization idea:

   Replace SystemAnalyzer template by a SystemMixIn class template to 
   reduce use of hierarchies of class templates. This would reduce depth 
   of template hierarchies only if it were added to final classes, rather
   than to AverageAnalyzer template. Have the MixIn constructor take 
   the Analyzer and the System as arguments, and have the constructor
   call the Analyzer::setFileMaster() function to provide a filemaster.
