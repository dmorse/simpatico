TODO:

 - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

Note: Checked 1/4/2013 with grep that all other analyzers have 
    save / loadParameters functions. Many have not been well tested.

New analyzers:

  - Write DihedralDistribution analyzer for dihedral angle
  - Write AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle
