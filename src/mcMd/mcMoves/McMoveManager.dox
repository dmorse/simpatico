\section mcMd_mcMove_McMoveManager_synopsis_sec Synopsis

An McMoveManager is a container for one or more Monte Carlo moves, i.e., 
of instances of subclasses of McMd::McMove.

\section mcMd_mcMove_McMoveManager_param_sec Parameter File Format

The parameter file format for an McMoveManager contains a series of any 
number of parameter file blocks for McMove objects, with one space
between McMove class blocks. Below is an example showing a parameter
block for an McMoveManager with two objects that are instances of 
fictitious McMove classes named McMove1 and McMove2, in which 
ellipses are used to represent the body of the parameter file format 
for each McMove.

\code
  McMoveManager{

    McMove1{
        ....
    }

    McMove2{
        ....
    }

  }
\endcode
The McMoveManager parameter file block may contain any number of such
blocks, but must contain at least one in order for the simulation to
function.

When an McMoveManager parameter block is read, the string in the opening 
line of each McMove subblock, without the opening bracket, is compared to 
a list of McMove subclass names. This list is defined by the implemenation 
of the associated McMoveFactory class. If the name is recognized, an object 
of the specified class is created and the body of its parameter file block 
is read by calling the readParameters() member function of the new object. 
If the name is not recognized, an Exception is thrown and execution halts.
