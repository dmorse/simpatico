The directory tree rooted at src/mcMd contains all of the classes in the 
McMd namespace, which are used in single-processor MC and MD programs, as
well as main programs mcSim.cpp and mdSim.cpp.

Source files in this directory tree, and in the McMd namespace, can use
classes and other names defined in the Util namespace (src/util directory) 
and the Inter namespace (src/inter directory), but may not use any names
defined in the DdMd namespace (src/ddMd directory). 

Subdirectories:
----------------------

chemistry      atoms, molecules, and covalent groups (bonds, etc.)
species        molecular species (i.e., molecular structures)
potentials     classes to evaluate potential energies and forces
  pair         nonbonded pair potentials
  bond         covalent bond potentials 
  angle        covalent three-body angle potentials
  dihedral     covalent four-body dihedral potentials
  link         mutable covalent bond potentials (e.g., crosslinks)
  external     external one-body potentials.
neighbor       cell list and Verlet pair list classes
links          management of crosslinks (mutable covalent bonds).
ensembles      classes that define statistical ensembles
simulation     main classes for constructing simulations
mcSimulation   Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation and System subclasses
mcMoves        classes for specific MC moves (derived from McMove)
mdSimulation   molecular dynamics (MD) Simulation and System subclasses
mdIntegrators  specific MD integrators (derived from MdIntegrator)
analyzers      data analysis (classes derived from Analyzer)
configIos      configuration file IO 
trajectoryIos  MD trajectory (multi-configuration) file IO.
perturb        free energy perturbation theory
misc           miscellaneous utilities

Makefile targets 
----------------

The makefile in src/mcMd directory can be used to execute in-source compilation 
of all of the classes in the directory tree rooted at src/mcMd, which include 
the entire McMc namespace, and build the corresponding library and executables. 
The most important targets are:

make all      make all *.o files for source files in the src/mcMd tree, build
              a static library mcMd<suffix>.a, and install two executables 
              named mdSim<suffix> and mcSim<suffix> in simpatico/bin/.

make clean    remove all files generated in src/mcMd by "make all", including
              object files, dependency files and the static library. Does not
              remove the resulting executable files from simpatico/bin/.
