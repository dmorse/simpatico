The directory tree rooted at src/mcMd contains all of the classes in the 
McMd namespace, which are used to construct the single-processor MC and MD 
main programs mcSim.cpp and mdSim.cpp, which are also in this directory.

Source files in this directory tree are all in the McMd namespace. By
convention, classes and functions defined in this namespace may use 
classes and other names defined in the Util namespace (src/util directory) 
and the Simp namespace (src/simp directory), but may not use any names
defined in the DdMd namespace (src/ddMd directory) or the Tools namespace
(src/tools).

Subdirectories:
----------------------

  bond         covalent bond potentials 
  angle        covalent three-body angle potentials
  dihedral     covalent four-body dihedral potentials
  coulomb      long-range coulomb potentials
  external     external one-body potentials.
  link         mutable covalent bond potentials (e.g., crosslinks)
neighbor       cell list and Verlet pair list classes
ensembles      classes that define statistical ensembles

user           space for user-defined classes
tests          unit tests
attic          obsolete or deprecated classes (not compiled)

Makefile targets 
----------------

The makefile in src/mcMd directory can be used to execute in-source compilation 
of all of the classes in the directory tree rooted at src/mcMd, which include 
the entire McMc namespace, and build the corresponding library and executables. 
The most important targets are:

make all      make all *.o files for source files in the src/mcMd tree, build
              a static library mcMd<suffix>.a, and install two executables 
              named mdSim<suffix> and mcSim<suffix> in simpatico/bin/.

make clean    remove all files generated in src/mcMd by "make all", including
              object files, dependency files and the static library. Does not
              remove the resulting executable files from simpatico/bin/.
