Simpatico provides an optional module that allows the use of the <a href=http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>Hoomd-blue</a> code for MD on the GPU as a fast engine for hybrid MC simulations.  In this mode, an instance of Hoomd-blue is used to implement a hybrid MC move within an mcSim simulation. Short NVE (for NVT ensemble) or NPH (for NPT ensembles) MD simulations are carried out on a GPU, while the main loop is implemented on the CPU, as are any other MC moves.  Integration with Hoomd-blue provides a dramatic increase in the speed of MD and HMC simulations: We obtain a speed-up by approximately a factor of 30 for for bead-spring polymer melts with repulsive Lennard-Jones (i.e., Weeks-Chandler-Anderson) pair interactions.
