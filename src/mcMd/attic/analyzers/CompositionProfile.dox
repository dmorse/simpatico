\section mcMd_analyzer_CompositionProfile_synopsis_sec Synopsis

This analyzer computes average monomer concentration profiles for all atom types along one or more directions, averaged over planes contstructed perpendicular to these directions.

\sa McMd::CompositionProfile

\section mcMd_analyzer_CompositionProfile_param_sec Parameters
The parameter file format is:
\code
   CompositionProfile{ 
      interval           int
      outputFileName     string
      nDirection         int
      intVectors         Array<IntVector> [nDirection]
      nBins              int
   }
\endcode
in which
<table>
  <tr> 
     <td> interval </td>
     <td> number of steps between data samples </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td> outputFileName </td>
     <td> name of output file </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td> nDirection </td>
     <td> number of directions (reciprocal vectors) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td> intVectors </td>
     <td> array of reciprocal lattice vectors, given using integer Miller indices (dimension = nDirection).
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> nBins </td>
     <td> number of bins in histogram for each profile </td>
  </tr>
</table>

\section mcMd_analyzer_CompositionProfile_output_sec Output

If nSamplePerBlock != 0, a time sequence of block average values of these quantities will be output to a file {outputFileName}.dat during the simulation. If nSamplePerBlock == 0, no such file is created.

Instantaneous histograms for each direction are output to file with a suffix *.log, with a separate file for each direction. Overall average profiles are output are output to {outputFileName}.dat, also with different files for different directions.
