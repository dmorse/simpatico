\section mcMd_analyzer_McEnergyOutput_synopsis_sec Synopsis

This analyzer periodically outputs values of all components of the 
potential energy to a file. 

\sa McMd::McEnergyOutput

\section mcMd_analyzer_McEnergyOutput_param_sec Parameters
The parameter file format is:
\code
  McEnergyOutput{
    interval           int
    outputFileName     string
  }
\endcode
with parameters
<table>
  <tr> 
     <td>interval</td>
     <td> number of steps between data samples </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td> outputFileName </td>
     <td> name of output file </td>
  </tr>
</table>

\section mcMd_analyzer_McEnergyOutput_output_sec Output

Instantaneous values of the total energy and its components are output to the file {outputFileName}.dat during a simulation, every interval time steps. Each row corresponds to one data sample.  Relevant energy components are listed in the order:

   [pair] [bond] [angle] [dihedral] [link] [external] [total]

Components of the energy that are not enabled in a simulation are not included. The file format used in a particular simulation is documented in {outputFileName}.prm, which is output at the end of the simulation.
