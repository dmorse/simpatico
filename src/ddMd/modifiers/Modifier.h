   /**
   * A Modifier can modify the time evolution of the simulation.
   *
   * Modifier is an abstract base class for classes that can modify the
   * system during an MD simulation, and thus modify the time evolution
   * defined by the integrator. The class declares a variety of virtual
   * functions that, when re-implemented and activated by subclasses, will
   * be invoked at specific points during the main integration loop, thus
   * allowing the designer of a subclass to add almost arbitrary actions
   * to the underlying integration algorithm. 
   *
   * The Modifier class declares interfaces for several virtual functions
   * that that the integrator can be instructed to invoke at specific
   * points within the body of the main integration loop. We refer to 
   * theses as integrator action functions. The name of each such function 
   * describes when it will be invoked. For example, the postForce() function
   * is invoked (if at all) immediately after evaluation of all forces 
   * within the main integration loop.  Modifier also declares several 
   * virtual functions with names that contain the words "pack" and "unpack",
   * which we will call communication functions, that may be defined by
   * subclasses to pack additional information into the messages that 
   * are communicated between processors during exchange and update steps.
   *
   * Each subclass of Modifier will normally implement only a few of 
   * these possible action and communication functions. To record which
   * virtual functions it defines, each subclass must also "activate" 
   * each such function by invoking the set() function within its 
   * constructor passing this function a named constant that activates
   * a particular virtual function. Thus, for example, a subclass that 
   * implements the virtual postForce() function must also call the
   * function set(Flags::PostForce) in its constructor. The constant 
   * Flags::PostForce and other named constants are defined as static 
   * constant members of the Modifier::Flags nested class. The name
   * of each such constant is given by a capitalized version of the
   * name of the corresponding virtual function. When the set() function
   * is invoked to activate an integrator or communication function,
   * it adds that function to list of functions that will be invoked 
   * at the appropriate point in the integration algorithm. The 
   * constants associated with communcation functions each activate 
   * a pair of associated "pack" and "unpack" function that must work
   * together pack additional information into an MPI message on one
   * processor and unpack it at the receiving processor. 
   *
   * Each Modifier also has an integer member named interval that
   * determines the interval, in time steps, with which integrator 
   * actions should be taken. An activated integrator action function 
   * will be executed only during time steps that are multiples of 
   * this interval. Each Modifier object has a single interval value,
   * which applies to all action function that it implements and
   * activates. The value of the interval is initialized to 1 (i.e.,
   * every time step) in the base Modifier class constructor, but may 
   * be reset in the subclass readParameters function by invoking the 
   * readInterval() function to read a value from file. 
   *
   * The design of the Modifier class was inspired by the Lammps "Fix" 
   * base class, which provides a very flexible framework for designing
   * algorithms that can modify the state of a system.
