   * A cell list used only to identify nearby atom pairs.
   *
   * An CellList divides the domain owned by a processor, plus a frame
   * containing ghost particles, into a grid of cells, such that the length
   * of each cell in each direction is greater than a specified cutoff
   * distance. The algorithm works with either generalized or Cartesian
   * coordinates, if used consistently.
   *
   * All operations of this class are local (no MPI).
   *

   *    CellList cellList;

   *    Vector   upper;        // Vector of upper bounds (local atoms)
   *    Vector   cutoffs;      // Vector of cutoff lengths for each axis.
   *    double   cutoff;       // minimum cell dimension
   *    int      atomCapacity  // max number of atoms on this processor
   *
   *    // Set elements of cutoffs vector to same value
   *    for (int i = 0; i < Dimension; ++i) {
   *       cutoffs[i] = cutoff;
   *    } 
   *
   *    // Bounds on lower and upper used here to allocate memory.
   *    cellList.allocate(atomCapacity, lower, upper, cutoffs);
   *  
   *    // Make the actual grid and clear it.
   *    cellList.makeGrid(lower, upper, cutoffs);
   *    cellList.clear();
   *
   *    // Place all local atoms.
   *    AtomStorage::AtomIterator  atomIter;
   *    for (storage.begin(atomIter); atomIter.notEnd(); ++atomIter) {

   *    }

   *    AtomStorage::GhostIterator ghostIter;
   *    for (storage.begin(ghostIter); ghostIter.notEnd(); ++ghostIter){
   *       cellList.placeAtom(*ghostIter);

   *    
   *    // Build cell list
   *    cellList.build();
   *
   *
   * \endcode
   *
   * The atomCapacity parameter should be set equal to the sum of atomCapacity 
   * and the ghostCapacity of the associated atomStorage, which is the maximum 
   * total number of atoms that can exist on this processor.
   *
   * If the upper and lower bounds and atom coordinates are all expressed in
   * generalized coordinates, which span 0.0 - 1.0 over the primitive periodic
   * cell in each direction, each element of the cutoffs vector is given by a
   * ratio cutoffs[i] = cutoff/length[i], where length[i] is the Cartesian
   * distance across the unit cell along a direciton parallel to reciprocal 
   * basis vector i. 
   *
   * See Cell documentation for an example of how to iterate over local cells 
   * and neighboring atom pairs.
