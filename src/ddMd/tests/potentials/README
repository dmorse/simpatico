BUG: The PairPotentialTest in this directory crashes in testRandom1, even 
though the PairPotential appears to be working fine in simulations. The 
test needs to be revisited to see if something has become outdated, e.g.,
a convention about where to rescaled vs. Cartesian coordinates. It is not 
used in the suite of tests defined in the parent directory. 

Run: The test in this directory is designed to be used with 6 processors.
Invoke ">make run" to run the test.
