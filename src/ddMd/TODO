Testing
-------

- Add test that number of inner neighbors is unchanged upon reneighboring.

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to allow
  for deforming boundaries. 

Constant Pressure:
------------------

- Finish and test methods to evaluate stress.

- Add vFlag and eFlag to Simulation, and as arguments to addForce() method 
  of each potential.

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.

Hybrid MD
----------

- Add arriving_ and departing_ pointer arrays to storage classes.

- Add lists of old atom positions to AtomStorage.

- Add methods to commit or revert the state of each storage.


Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Make AtomTag struct a public class, add an IntVector of micro-cell 
  indices to CellTag, to allow fast rejection of most pairs.

- Modify Cell::getNeighbors method to pass back a list of AtomTag objects, 
  rather than an array of pointers. Provide a CellList method to decide if 
  a particular pair is within the cutoff.

- Improve testing of PairList - check that number of inner pairs doesn't
  change upon reneighboring, in unit tests and as optional test in main
  loop.


Configuration File IO
---------------------

- Add LammpsConfigIo class


Buffer:
-------

- Add memory statistics for Buffer.

- Figure out how to make pack/unpack methods of the atom class, so 
  that they can use private information. Would also simplify the 
  introduction of new Atom class variants (e.g., a dipolar Atom).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes
  to work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable 
  single processor operation with no MPI.


Atom Class Implementation
--------------------------

- see doc/notes/ddMd/Atom file


Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.
