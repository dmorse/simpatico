   /**
   * Class template for distributing Group<N> objects among processors.
   *
   * A GroupDistributor is used to distribute items among processors during
   * startup, when the master process must read a configuration file.  The
   * loops to distribute Groups (bonds, angles, or dihedrals) requires access
   * to an DArray<int> atomOwners[i] in which atomOwners[i] is the rank of 
   * the processor that owns atom i.
   *
   * Usage:
   * \code
   * 
   *    GroupDistributor  distributor;
   *    GroupStorage<N>   groupStorage;
   *    DArray<int>       atomOwners;
   *    Group<N>*         ptr;
   *    std::ifstream file
   *
   *    if (rank = 0) {  // If master processor
   *
   *       distributor.setup();
   *
   *       // Read from file
   *       for (i = 0; i < nGroup; ++i) {
   *
   *           ptr = distributor.newPtr();
   *  
   *           // Read properties of Group<N> *ptr from file
   *           file >> ptr->position();
   *           // ...
   *
   *           // Cache active Group<N> for sending.
   *           distributor.add(groupStorage, atomOwners);
   *       }
   *
   *       // Send all remaining.
   *       distributor.send();
   *
   *    } else { // If not master processor
   *
   *       distributor.receive(groupStorage);
   *
   *    }
   * \endcode
   * The add(groupStorage) method can send items if required by
   * memory limits, and the send() method then sends all remaining
   * groups.
