   * Class for distributing Atoms among processors.
   *
   * A AtomDistributor is used to distribute items among processors during
   * startup, when the master process must read a configuration file.
   *
   * Usage:
   * \code
   * 
   *    AtomDistributor   distributor;
   *    AtomStorage   storage;
   *    Atom*         ptr;
   *    std::ifstream file
   *
   *    if (rank = 0) {  // If master processor
   *
   *       distributor.setup();
   *
   *       // Read from file
   *       for (i = 0; i < nAtom; ++i) {
   *
   *           ptr = distributor.newAtomPtr();
   *  
   *           // Read properties of Atom *ptr from file
   *           file >> ptr->position();
   *           // ...
   *
   *           // Cache active atom *ptr for sending.
   *           distributor.addAtom(storage);
   *       }
   *
   *       // Send all remaining.
   *       distributor.send();
   *
   *    } else { // If not master processor
   *
   *       distributor.receive(storage);
   *
   *    }
   *
   * \endcode
   * The addAtom(storage) method can send items if required by
   * memory limits, and the send() method then sends all remaining
   * atoms.
