TODO:
-----

1) Write OrthoBoundaryAnalyzer.

2) Modify PairEnergyAnalyzer to allow averages for more than one pair 
   component.

3) Modify StressAnalyzer so as to keep track of virial and kinetic
   separately. Then stash class OutputStressTensor.

4) Modify PressureAnalyzer so as to keep track of virial and kinetic
   separately. Then stash class OutputPressure.

5) Check atom shift flags, and design mean-squared displacement
   analyzers for individual atoms that makes use of them. (Center
   of mass of a molecule is harder, and still requires some
   post processing).

6) Standardize analyzer outputs, write as subclasses of base class when 
   possible. Below is a list of analyzers grouped into types that 
   correspond to possible base classes. Limitation: Don't bother to 
   create a base class when very little code is required aside from
   what is already in the accumulator. 

7) Move some base classes to Simp namespace, to allow outputs to be 
   standardized in both DdMd and McMd namespaces.  Proposal: Do McMd 
   after standardizing classes in DdMd and then moving some of 
   functionality up the class hierarchy.
