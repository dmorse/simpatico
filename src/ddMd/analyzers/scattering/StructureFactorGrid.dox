\section ddMd_analyzer_StructureFactorGrid_overview_sec Synopsis

This analyzer calculates the structure factor for all wavevectors within
a grid, for all integer wavevector indices up to some maximum value. It also groups together values from "stars" of wavevectors that are related by symmetry, such as the {100} family of 6 wavevectors, and outputs a single average value for the entire star.

The DdMd::StructureFactorGrid class is a subsclass of DdMd::Structure factor. Like DdMd::StructureFactor, it calculates the structure factor at a set of wavevectors, using a specified set of "modes" for each wavevector. See the documentation of DdMd::Structure factor for an explanation of the notation of "modes", and the parameter file format for specifying modes.

\section ddMd_analyzer_StructureFactorGrid_out_sec Output Files

Final values are output to {outputFileName}.data. Each row is a star of symmetry related reciprocal lattice vectors, each column is a mode.
