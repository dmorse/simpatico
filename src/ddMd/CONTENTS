This directory contains source code for a domain-decomposition (DD)
parallel molecular dynamics (MD) program and associated analysis tools. 
All of the code in this directory is defined in the DdMd namespace. 
The ddSim parallel MD code uses a domain-decomposition parallelization 
strategy similiar to that used in LAMMPS and many other parallel MD codes. 

Source files in the DdMd namespace (or src/ddMd/ directory) uses classes and 
other names defined in the Util and Simp namespaces (or the src/util/ and 
sr/simp/ directories), but do not use any names from the McMD namespace (or 
the src/mcMd/ subdirectory). Most files in the DdMd namespace contain a 
"using namespace Util" directive that brings the entire Util namespace into 
scope.  The few source files that use classes from the Simp namespace also 
contain a "using namespace Simp" directive.
