<BR>

Users may extend the capabilities of Simpatico by writing new subclasses of a set of base classes that represent elements of a simulation. Different base class are used to represent molecular species, potential energy functions, analyzers, file formats, and Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics algorithms.

The procedure for adding a new capability or algorithm generally involves three steps:
<ul>
  <li>Write a new C++ class that implements the new capability. This should be derived from one of the existing base classes. </li>
  <li>Incorporate the new class into the simpatico build system, so it can be compiled and linked into one or more executables. </li>
  <li>Modify the implementation of an associated Factory class, so that the parameter file block associated with the new class will be recognized if it appears in a parameter file. 
</ul>
For larger projects, one can also  organize a set several related classes that implement related algorithms into a Module. Each of the these procedures is discussed in greater greater detail in the following subpages.
