<BR>

Users must run a bash script named "setup" before attempting to compile 
any code.  This script is located in the simpatico/ root directory, and 
must be executed from this directory. The setup script installs a variety 
of files that are needed to compile simpatico but that are not created 
by cloning the github repository.  The files installed by this script 
include configuration files that a user may need to modify in order to
adapt the simpatico build system to a particular environment or to 
enable optional features, and other makefile fragments and C++ files 
that users commonly need to modify in order to add new capabilities. It 
is only necessary to invoke the setup script once, before the first time 
you compile any code.

The most important file created by the setup script a file named config.mk
in the simpatico/src directory, which is the main configuration file. This 
file is a makefile fragment that defines variables that specify (among 
other things) the names of the commands used to compile serial and 
MPI-enabled code, and some command line options that are passed to the 
compiler. Users are free to edit this file after it is created as needed
to adapt the configuration to a particular system, compiler and MPI 
library. Explanations of the variables defined in this file are given in
extensive comments in the file. 

\section install_setup_default_sec Default configuration 

To create a default configuration appropriate for a generic unix-like 
environment, change directory (cd) to the simpatico/ root directory,
and then enter:
\code
> ./setup
\endcode
Note the dot and backslash ("./") before the name of the script.  These 
must be included to tell the unix shell to look for a script named setup 
in the current working directory, rather than searching the directories 
listed in the PATH environment variable for a command with this name.
The default configuration created by this command assumes that you will
compile serial code with the gcc compiler, using the g++ compiler command, 
and that MPI code will be compiled using a wrapper script named "mpicxx".

\section install_setup_special_sec Specialized configuration 

To create predefined configurations for the other types of system, the 
setup script may also be invoked with a single argument that gives the 
name of a file containing definitions of variables appropriate to a 
particular choice of compiler and computing environment.  For example, 
invoking the command
\code
\> ./setup intel
\endcode
would instead create configuration files with settings appropriate to 
a linux system on which one uses the intel C++ compiler. 

When the setup script is invoked with such an argument, the argument 
(e.g.  "intel") must be the name of a file that exists in the directory 
simpatico/make/compiler. Each file in that directory contains a set of 
variable definitions that specify compiler commands and options 
appropriate to a specific combination of compiler, MPI library and 
operating system environment.  We refer to these files as compiler 
setup files. When the setup script is invoked with an argument, it 
reads the associated compiler setup file and copies the definitions 
given in the setup file into a new config.mk configuration file that 
is created by the setup script.

When the the setup script is invoked with no argument, the script reads
a file named "simpatico/make/gcc" by default. Invoking setup with no 
argument is thus equivalent to invoking "./setup gcc". 

\section install_setup_local_file_sec Customized configuration

The "simpatico/src/make/compiler" directory initially contains only a 
few compiler setup files, such "gcc" and "intel". If none of these is 
exactly appropriate for a users system, the user may create a local 
customized version as follows:

  - Create a copy of one of the files in the src/make compiler directory 
    with a new name such as "local", e.g., by entering 
    \code
    > cp gcc local
    \endcode
    from within the simpatico/make/compiler director.

  - Use a text editor (e.g., vi or emacs) to modify the variable definitions 
    in the new file as needed to accomodate a particular system.

  - Rerun the "setup" script using the name of the new file as an argument, 
    e.g., by entering
    \code
    > ./setup local
    \endcode
    from the simpatico/ root directory.

In order to understand the meanings of the variables defined in the compiler 
setup files, we recommend that you first run the setup script with no argument 
and the read the comments in the file src/config.mk that is created by the 
setup script, which briefly explain the meaning of each of the makefile 
variables. If you compare the resulting file to the file make/compiler/gcc, 
you will see that the "gcc" compiler setup file will have simply been copied 
into the middle part of the config.mk file. 

Users may change values of variables defined in the main configuration file
either by making a customized compiler setup file in the src/make/compiler
directory before running the setup script, or by editing the file
src/config.mk after running the setup script, or both.
