The html documentation that you are reading was generated using the 
<a href=http://www.doxygen.org> doxygen </a> documentation utility. The 
simpatico git repository contains all of the source files required to 
construct this documentation (some of which is extracted from comments 
in the C++ source files), but does not retain the resulting html files. 

\section install_doc_generate_sec Generating documentation
 
If the doxygen program is installed on your machine, you can regenerate a 
local copy of the html documentation.  To check whether doxygen is installed, 
enter 
\code
> which doxygen
\endcode
 from the command line. If a valid path to a file named doxygen is returned, 
then doxygen is already installed. If doxygen is not installed, install it 
before proceeding, either using an appropriate package manager or by 
downloading from the doxygen web page. 

Once doxygen is installed, simply change directory to the simpatico/ root 
directory and enter
\code
> make html 
\endcode
The resulting html files will be installed in the simpatico/doc/html/ directory. 

\section install_doc_read_sec Reading the documentation
 
The main page of the html documentation is a file named doc/html/index.html.
To begin reading your local copy of the documentation, simply open this file 
in any web browser. To read the documentation on a linux system using the 
firefox browser, enter
\code
> firefox doc/html/index.html
\endcode
from the simpatico/ root directory. On a Mac, on can instead use the "open" 
command to open this file with the default browser, by entering
\code
> open doc/html/index.html
\endcode 
from a terminal. Alternatively, one can use the Finder to navigate to the 
simpatico/doc/html folder, double click on any file in that directory with 
an *.html file extension, and then click on the "main page" button in the
upper left to go to the main page (i.e., the index.html page).

The text of the main manual pages, including the page you are now reading, 
is contained in a set of files with file extension *.dox in the doc/manual 
directory. These are written in plain text with a few formatting commands, 
and can also be read with any text editor. Files in the src/ directory 
with the file extension *.dox or *.mod contain other parts of the doxygen
documentation.  In addditional, API documentation for each C++ class and
function is extracted by doxygen from documentation blocks in every
C++ header file. 

\section install_doc_clean_sec Cleaning up
 
To delete all html documentation from the doc/html directory and start
over, enter
\code
> make clean-html
\endcode
from the simpatico/ root directory.
