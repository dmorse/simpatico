<BR>

To compile simpatico in a unix environment, before compiling any code, 
the user should modify the following unix environment variables:

  - Add the simpatico simpatico/bin directory to the unix PATH shell 
    environment variable (the shell command search path)

  - Add the simpatico/scripts/python directory to the PYTHONPATH 
    environment variable (the python module search path)

Rationale: 

  - By default, executables files created by the simpatico build system
    are installed in the simpatico/bin directory.  The directory in
    which these files are located must be added to the users PATH
    variable in order to allow the unix shell to find the executable 
    files when they are invoked by name from a command line in order
    to run a simulation.

  - The simpatico/scripts/python directory contains a python script that 
    is used by the build system during compilation to generate information 
    about dependencies among C++ files. This directory must be added to 
    the PYTHONPATH variable in order to allow the python interpreter to
    find this file. 

To make these changes using a bash shell, add some variant of the 
following lines to your the .profile or .bash_profile file in your user 
home directory:
\code
SIMPATICO_DIR=${HOME}/simpatico
export PATH=${PATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/bin
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/scripts/python
\endcode
The value of SIMPATICO_DIR should be set to the path to the simpatico 
root directory (i.e., the root of the directory tree created by cloning 
the simpatico repository).  In the above fragment, as an example, it is 
assumed that the simpatico/ directory is a subdirectory of the users 
home directory. 

After adding an appropriate variant of these lines to .profile or 
.bash_profile, log out, log back in, and then enter "echo $PATH" and 
"echo $PYTHONPATH" to make sure that these variables have been set 
correctly.
