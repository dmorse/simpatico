<BR>

The MdPp namespace (in the src/MdPp directory) contains classes that are the building blocks for the mdPp program, which is a single-processor postprocessor that can be used to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by a ddSim simuation. Many of the classes in this namespace have names that are identical to analogous classes in the DdMd namespace. Thus, for example MdPp::Atom is a variant of the DdMd::Atom class that is designed for use in single-processor analysis algorithms.

\section MdPp_chemistry_sec Chemical structure

The src/MdPp/chemistry subdirectory contains a set of classes that describe atoms and covalent groups that are (for the most part) closely analogous to classes in the ddMd/chemistry directory, but are designed for single-processor configurations. Among these are the following classes:

   - MdPp::Atom represents a single particle. It contains most (but not all) of the information stored in an DdMd::Atom.  

   - MdPp::Group < int N > is a class template that represents a group of N covalently interacting atoms. A Group<N> object has an array of integer atom ids and a group type id. 

   - MdPp::Molecule represents a molecule that contains a sequence of Atom objects.

   - MdPp::Species is a set of structurally identical molecules.

\section MdPp_Storage_sec Storage classes

The src/MdPp/storage subdirectory contains a set of containers analogous to those in src/ddMd/storage:

   - MdPp::AtomStorage is a container for MdPp::Atom objects.

   - MdPp::GroupStorage  < int N > is a template for containers of MdPp::Group objects.

\section MdPp_Configuration_sec Configuration

The Configuration class contains an entire instantaneous system configuration. A Configuration object has:
   - a Simp::Boundary 
   - an MdPp::AtomStorage 
   - MdPp::GroupStorage containers for bonds, angles, and dihedrals
   - a MdPp::Species object for each chemical species

\section MdPp_Analyzer_sec Analyzers

The src/MdPp/analyzer subdirectory contains a set of classes that are used for analysis of single-processor configurations. 
MdPp::Analyzer is an abstract base class for classes that implement data analysis and/or data output operations. 
MdPp::AnalyzerManager is a container for a set of MdPp::Analyzer objects.

See also: \ref MdPp_Analyzer_Module "MdPp Analyzer Module"

\section MdPp_Processor_sec Processor

A MdPp::Processor is a top level object for postprocessing of MD configurations and trajectories. The Processor class is derived from Configuration, but also has an AnalyzerManager, and provides functions that can read, analyze, and write configuration and trajectory files.
