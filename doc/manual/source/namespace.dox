The classes used in simpatico are divided into five namespaces. The source code for each namespace is in a corresponding subdirectory of the src/directory: 

 - namespace Util (directory src/util) contains general utilities for C++ programming and scientific computation. 

 - namespace Simp (directory src/simp) contains general classes for all simpatico simulation and analysis programs. 

 - namespace McMd (directory src/mcMd) contains classes for single-processor Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, for the mcSim and mdSim programs.

 - namespace DdMd (in directory src/ddMd) contains classes for a parallel domain-decomposition molecular dynamics code, and for the ddSim program.

 - namespace MdPp (in directory src/mdPp) contains classes for pre- and postprocessing of molecular dynamics trajectories, and the main program for the mdPp executable. 

The code in some namespaces depends on symbols defined in others. A namespace named B is said to "depend" on another namespace A if any class in namespace B uses any classes or other symbols defined in A. The Simp, McMd, DdMd, and MdPp namespaces all depend on the Util namespace, in this sense. The dependencies are:

 - Util does not depend on any other namespace

 - Simp depends only on Util

 - McMd, DdMd, and MdPp each depends on Util and Simp, but not on each other.

A few of the most important classes in each namespace are introduced in the following pages. An alternate, and more complete, view of all of the classes in each namespace may be obtained clicking on the "Modules" link above and browsing a hierarchy of modules. Each module within a namespace contain a sets of functionally related classes.
