Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC) and hybrid MC simulations of molecular and polymer liquids.  It has thus far been used to simulate coarse-grained models of polymer liquids, but is suitable for a much wider range of problems. It contains the following main programs:

- A program for parallel domain-decomposition MD simulations, named ddSim.

- Programs for MC and MD simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

The single-processor mcSim and mdSim programs can also be compiled with MPI to execute embarassingly parallel multi-processor algorithms, such as replica-exchange, in which each processor simulates a different system.
