Simpatico has been developed since 2010 in David Morse's research group at the University of Minnesota. The main contributors have
been:
<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li> David Morse (primary author) </li>
  <li> Jian Qin (MC algorithms, angle and dihedral potentials) </li>
  <li> Jens Glaser (constant pressure MD integrators) </li>
  <li> Pavani Medapuram (replica exchange, perturbation theory, interactions) </li>
  <li> Taher Ghasimakbari (analyzers, interactions, improvements to ddMd) </li>
</ul>

Simpatico was written as a rewrite of a code named PMC that was used at the University of Minnesota from 2006-2009 by Jun Chung and Jian Qin. PMC was not distributed outside of our research group. Many of the MC algorithms for flexible polymers available in mcSim were written by these two contributors and then ported to simpatico by Jian Qin.
