Simpatico has been developed since 2010 in David Morse's research group 
at the University of Minnesota. The main contributors have
been:
<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li> David Morse (primary author) </li>
  <li> Jian Qin (MC algorithms, angle and dihedral potentials) </li>
  <li> Jens Glaser (HOOMD-blue integration and constant pressure MD integrators) </li>
  <li> Pavani Medapuram (replica exchange and perturbation theory) </li>
</ul>

Simpatico was written as a rewrite of a code named PMC that was used at the University of Minnesota from 2006-2009 by Jun Chung and Jian Qin. PMC was not distributed outside of our research group. Many of the MC algorithms for flexible polymers used in mcSim were written by these two users and then ported to Simpatico by Jian Qin.
