<p>The simpatico build system allows a user to perform in-source compilation of some or all of the source code. This ability is provided as a convenience to developers who prefer to be able to compile some or all of the code from the unix command line without leaving the directory tree in which they are editing source code files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_compile_insource_src_sec"></a>
Invoking make from the src/ directory</h1>
<p>To peform an in-source build of any of the simpatico programs, one may simply invoke the make utility from the src/ directory rather than from the simpatico/ root directory, using the same makefile target name as that used to perform of an out-of-source build when invoking make from the simpatico/ directory. Thus for example, to peform an in-source build of mcSim and mdSim, one may simply invoke "make mcMd" from the src/ directory. The relevant makefile targets, for either in-source or out-of-source builds, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"make mcMd" builds mcSim and mdSim</li>
<li>"make mdPp" builds mdPp</li>
<li>"make ddMd" builds ddSim</li>
<li>"make mcMd-mpi" builds mcSim_m and mdSim_m</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that mcSim_m and mdSim_m are the multiprocessor versions of the mcSim and mdSim programs. When invoked from the src/ directory, each of these targets will cause make to place object, dependency and library files in the simpatico/src/ directory tree. Both in-source and out-of-source builds install the resulting executable program or programs in the simpatico/bin directory by default.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_compile_insource_makeall_sec"></a>
Invoking "make all" from a subdirectory of src/</h1>
<p>It is also possible to invoke make from a subdirectory of src/ in order to compile a smaller set of source files. Invoking the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree that contains C++ source code will compile all C++ files in the tree rooted at that subdirectory, without compiling any code outside of that subdirectory.</p>
<p>Invoking "make all" from any namespace level subdirectory of src/ (i.e., from the src/util, src/simp, src/mcMd, src/ddMd or src/tools directory) will cause make to compile all the *.cpp source files in the namespace level directory tree, create a library containing all of the resulting object code, and compile and install any main programs for which the source files are in that directory.</p>
<p>Invoking "make all" from any subdirectory of a namespace level directory of src/ will cause make to compile all of the source files in that subdirectory, including any in lower level subdirectories.</p>
<p>The ability to invoke "make all" from any subdirectory of src/ is designed to allow developers to easily recompile a few files from the command line from within the directory in which they are working. Typically, when a developer is adding a new feature or fixing a bug, he or she will be actively editing only a few files within some subdirectory of the source directory, while the other files in that directory are left untouched. Under these circumstances, if all files other than the ones that were recently modified have already been compiled, invoking "make all" from the directory containing the files of interest will only recompile source files that have recently been modified or that include header files that have recently been modified.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_compile_insource_mpi_sec"></a>
Managing MPI Settings</h1>
<p>One important complication of building in-source arises when both both serial and parallel programs are built in the same build directory. The simpatico package contains both a set of serial programs that do not use MPI (the mcSim, mdSim and mdPp programs), and a set of parallel programs that use MPI (the ddSim program and the parallel versions of mcSim and mdSim). These two sets of programs use many of the same C++ classes, but must be compiled with different compiler options in order to enable or disable conditional features of those that rely on MPI.</p>
<p>All simpatico C++ files used by a parallel MPI program must be compiled with MPI enabled in the makefile system. When make is invoked from the src/ directory with a target that compiles parallel code (i.e., "make ddMd" or "make mcMd-mpi"), the makefile system automatically enables MPI before attempting to MPI is enabled. MPI is enabled by defining the UTIL_MPI makefile variable in the main configuration file, which can be accomplished by invoking the configure script with the "-m1" option. Enabling MPI in the makefile system causes the compiler to be passed a command line option ("-DUTIL_MPI") that enables conditional compilation of segments of code that use MPI.</p>
<p>Source files used by any serial programs, which does not use MPI, must instead compiled with MPI disabled. When make is invoked from the the src/ directory with a target that builds serial code (e.g., "make mcMd"), the makefile system automatically disables MPI before compiling any code. This disables conditional conditional compilation of segments of code that use MPI.</p>
<p>If a user invokes make from the src/ directory to first build a serial program or and programs (e.g., by invoking "make mcMd" to build mdSim and mcSim) and then uses a different target to build a parallel program (e.g., by invoking "make ddMd" to build ddSim), the build system will compile a large number of files that are used by both serial and parallel programs twice, once with MPI disabled and once with MPI enabled. If both serial and parallel programs are built in the src/ directory, the set of object files created when these shared files were compiled with MPI enabled will overwrite those created when the same files were compiled with MPI disabled, thus wasting all the effort that went into compiling the serial versions of these files. Similarly, if a user then goes back to working on a serial program after building a parallel program, all of those shared files will need to be compiled again. All of the files in the util/ and simp/ directories are used by both serial and parallel programs, and the code in the mcMd/ directory can be compiled with or without MPI enabled to produce serial and parallel versions of mcSim and mdSim. To avoid unnecessary recompilation of the code in these directories, users who compile in-source should thus avoid switching back and forth frequently between work on parallel and serial programs. The simpatico system for out-of-source compilaton avoids this problem by compiling serial and parallel programs in different build directories, named bld/serial and bld/parallel.</p>
<p>When a user invokves make from the src/ directory with one of the main makefile targets (e.g., "mcmd", "mcMd-mpi", "ddMd", or "tools"), the makefile system automatically enables or disables MPI, as appropriate, before attempting to compile any code. If this leads to a change in the state of MPI, the makefile system will detect the resulting change in the main configuration file, which will force the system to recompile any code that was previously compiled with a different MPI setting. When "make all" is invoked from a subdirectory of src/, however, the make utility does not attempt to enable or disable MPI, and simply uses the current setting. When a user invokes "make all" from a subdirectory of src/, he or she is thus responsible for keeping track of whether MPI is enabled or disabled in the src/ directory, and invoking "./configure -m1" or "./configure -m0" as needed to enable or disable MPI.</p>
