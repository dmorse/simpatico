TODO:

1) Re-organize user guide to make it easier for users find what they 
   are looking for. New organization:

    3.1  - Running a Simulation 
    3.2  - Parameter Files
    3.3  - Command Files 
    3.4  - Configuration Files 
    3.5  - Examples 
    3.6  - Potential Energy
    3.7  - Molecular Dynamics Integrators 
            - mdSim integrators
            - ddSim integrators
    3.8  - Monte Carlo Moves 
    3.9  - Molecular Species  <- add example block
   *3.10 - Data Analysis
           3.10.1 Analyzer Classes <- add example of AnalyzerManger block
             - Analyzers for mdSim or mcSim
             - Analyzers for ddSim 
           *3.10.2 Writing Trajectories <- Edit (barely exists)
           *3.10.3 Postprocessing with mdSim or mcSim
           *3.10.4 Postprocessing with mdPp <- To be written
   *3.10 - Generating Initial Configurations  <- new, explain command syntax
    3.12 - Restarting
    3.13 - Multi-System Simulations
   *3.14 - Perturbation (new)
   *3.15 - Class Documentation (new - explain where to find information)

2) Document changes to the parameter file format caused by enabling 
   particular features. This requires creating a *.dox file for every
   subclass of ParamComposite and finding a place to list them all as
   subpages. Create lists in Source Code Overview and reference 
   elsewhere?

4) In developer section of manual:

    - Segregate and rewrite information specific to ddMd and mcMd
    - Edit discussion of parameter file IO
    - Add discussion of serialization

Thoughts on commands:
---------------------
Rename OUTPUT_INTEGRATOR to OUTPUT_TIME
Rename CLEAR_INTEGRATOR to CLEAR (since it clears everything)

Consider adding OUTPUT_MEMORY, OUTPUT_TIME, OUTPUT_ANALYSIS, and CLEAR 
commands for mdSim and mcSim to make them more similar to ddSim. This 
might make the "CONTINUE" command for mcSim and mdSim unnecessary -
running a simulation multiple times would continue the simulation 
unless one calls clear.

Add default - if a simulation has been run and OUTPUT_ANALYSIS has not
been called, output when FINISH is called.  This would require adding 
a variable named something like isClear to the analyzer manager.
