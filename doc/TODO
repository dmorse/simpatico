TODO:

1) Re-organize user guide to make it easier for users find what they 
   are looking for. Possible organization (think about this again):

   - Running a Simulation (good)
   - Parameter Files (good)
   - Command Files (good)
   - Configuration Files (good)
   - Examples (pretty good, check if up to date)
   * Potential Energies (new)
   * Simulation Algorithms (list and explain options)
      - ddSim integrators
      - mdSim integrators
      - mcSim McMoves 
   * Analyzers
      Explain use of analyzers, briefly postprocessing
      - Analyzers for ddSim 
      - Analyzers for mdSim or mcSim
      - Analyzers for mdSim 
      - Analyzers for mcSim 
   * Postprocessing
      - One the fly
      - Post-processing
   - Perturbation (new)
   - Restarting (check if up to date)
   - Multi-System Simulations
   * Guide to Documentation (new - Where to find information)

2) Document all of the analyzers, with one *.dox file per interaction 
   in new directories doc/analyzers/ddMd and doc/analyzers/mcMd.

3) Document changes to the parameter file format caused by enabling 
   particular features. This requires creating a *.dox file for every
   subclass of ParamComposite and finding a place to list them all as
   subpages. Create lists in Source Code Overview and reference 
   elsewhere?
