Goal:

To create an independent serialization system, in which the entire internal state 
is stored in a single binary file. 

Serialization methods: save and load vs. serialize template
-----------------------------------------------------------

Which classes will use the serialize method template and which will use save and 
load virtual functions?

i) Polymorphic classes, which are accessed through a base class pointer, must all 
be Serializable, and must use the virtual save and load methods. This includes all 
of the Species, Diagnostic, McMove, MdIntegrator and Potential classes in McMd, 
and all Diagnostic, Integrator, and Potential classes in DdMd.

ii) Classes that own polymorphic classes will generally also need to be Serializable,
and implement save and load methods, since they require substantially different 
interfaces for saving and loading. This includes all of the Manager, System, and 
Simulation classes.

ii) Other Classes that read and write to the parameter file could use either 
the save and load methods, implemented using saveParam() and loadParam() methods, 
or a serialize() method template, implemented using serializeParam() methods.
Such classes include: ensembles, PairList and CellList, and FileMaster.

Conclusion: It is probably simplest to just use save and load for all subclasses 
of ParamComposite. Do not make ParamComposite a subclass of Serializable, just 
add as an additional base class for subclasses.

Since Serializable is a pure interface, perhaps rename as ISerializable.

ParamComposite:
---------------

For each subclass of Parameter, add load() and save() methods analogous to
the readParam and writeParam methods. Like the readParam() methods, these
can deal intelligently with the need to read on some nodes and broadcast
to others. 

In ParamComposite, add load<T> and save<T> method templates analogous to the 
read<T> and write<T> templates. The load method can use the add<T> method and 
then simply call the load method of the parameter rather than the readParam
method.

In ParamComposite, add loadComposite<T> method which adds the composite to
the format list before actually loading it. 

In ParamComposite, add a default save() method that calls the save methods
of all items in the format list. Subclasses could all ParamComposite::save()
explicitly, then add additional information. 

Manager Classes:
----------------

The save method of a Manager class must save the number of items, followed
by a set of items. Each item must contain a class name, followed by the
rest of the saved state of the item. 

The load method of a Manager will read the name of each item, and use the
Factory to create the required object and read the remainder of the file
block for that object. 

Add saveItem() and loadItem() methods to the Manager.h template, and 
create default save() and load() methods for all subclasses of Manager<T>.

Util Classes
------------

FileMaster     -> needs save and load methods.
Random         -> has serialize method. save and load methods could call this.
ensembles      -> need save and load methods.
containers     -> pointer arrays need serialize method to allocate arrays.

Boundary       -> already have serialize methods

Inter Classes
-------------

All interactions should have serialize methods.
