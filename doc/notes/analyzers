Idea / Work Plan:
-----------------

  - Standardize file formats for existing classes

  - Include time step in all streaming output formats

  - Refactor existing classes to separate all non-generic
    code into a ``compute" function, and standardize names 
    of sampled variables (e.g., to value_ or an array 
    values_) to make it easy to replace repeated code with 
    base classes and template patern

  - Move on-the-fly output outside of the Average class to 
    allow more flexible output formats.

  - Move test for isAtInterval outside the analyzer class

  - Develop base classes for analogous classes (see below),
    to help standardize file formats and avoid repetition.

  - Develop python and matlab classes to analyze and plot 
    the outputs

Analyzer Types (or base classes):
---------------------------------

T = data type
N = name type

Average:                    Average of a single global scalar
                            - Total energy
                            - Total kinetic energy
                            - Total pressure
                            - RadiusGyration
AverageList<N>              Container of averages, with ids of type N
                            - Energy components (string ids)
                            - Pressure components (string ids)
                            - StructureFactor (names are IntVector indices)
AverageMatrix:              container of averages, accessible by id pair
                            PairEnergyAverage
TensorAverage:              Stress
TensorAverageList<N>:       Stress components

AutoCorrAnalyzer<T>:        StressAutoCorr
MsdEnsmeble<T>:             AtomMsd, MoleculeComMsd
AutoCorrEnsemble<T>:        IntraPairAutoCorr (T = Vector)
                            IntraBondTensorAutoCorr (T = Tensor)
AutoCorrList<T,N>:          VanHove functions (N = IntVector, Miller indices)

DistributionAnalyzer:       single distribution (energy?)
DistributionList<K>:        list of distinct distributions
                            Box size distribution
                            Bond length distribution (multiple bond types)

File Types:
-----------

Each analyzer may produce several files of different types, with the same 
base name but different extensions:

  - Parameter files: A parameter file, with extension *.prm, reproduces 
    the parameter file block associated with an analyzer. The first line
    of this can be used by a parser to determine which analyzer this is.

  - Data files: A data file, with extension *.dat contains a sequence of 
    values, along with corresponding time step stamps

  - Format files: A format file, with extension *.fmt, gives names and 
    data types for the columns in the associated *.dat file

  - An average file contains final average values, with error estimates, 
    for one or more quantities.

  - An average-error file, with extension type *.aer, contains further 
    information about hierarchical error analysis of averages

Parser Design:
--------------

  An automatic parser, written in python, could use the fact that related 
  files are required to have the same base name to understand the contents 
  of an output directory. The first line of a *.prm file can be used to 
  determine the type of analyzer, and any required input parameters. A 
  parser with a list of known analyzers can then figure out what to do. 
  The format file can be used to document the content of data files. 
  Python classes for specific analyzers can have a hierarchy that mimics
  the heirarchy of analyzer classes. The whole thing would be designed to
  infer the contents of a directory with minimal input data, and allow
  interactive plotting.

Data Files:
-----------

  Data file is a multicolumn text file format for a time sequence of 
  data. The first column contains a time step identifier. Any number 
  of subsequent columns may follow, separated by spaces. 

Average Files:
--------------

  An average file contains average values and error estimates for one 
  or more quantities. Each quantity is on a line of the form:

  [variable name] = [average] +- [error]

  where variable name is a string, and average and error are real values.  
  Analyzers that evaluate a list of quantities can contain several lines, 
  separated by spaces, as in:

  pair       = 3814.111 +- 0.023487
  bond       = 1289.207 +- 0.014502
  potential  = .... +- ....
  kinetic    = .... +- ....
  total      = .... +- ....

  Averages for tensors should be preceded by a variable name, and 
  should use a format that lists indices, as in:

  stress [tensor symmetric] = 
     0 0  .... +- .....
     1 0  .... +- .....

  The notation in square brackets can indicate a type of multiline 
  item, e.g., [vector], [tensor], [tensor symmetric], etc.

Format Files:
-------------

  A format file gives names for the columns in a corresponding data 
  file.  The first line contains the number of columns.  Each of the 
  following lines gives the identifier for a column or group of 
  related columns, followed by a type.

  Example: Energy analyzer

    6
    0 iStep [int]
    1 pair  [real]
    2 bond  [real]
    3 potential [real]
    4 kinetic [real] 
    5 total [real]

  Vectors and tensors can be shown as clusters of columns, as 
  in the following example:

  Example: Stress Analyzer
    9
    0  iStep
    1-6  stress [tensor symmetric] {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)}
    7-9  pressure [vector] {0,1,2}

  This would require that multi-component objects be output in a standard 
  order, so that they can be read and manipulated as single objects. The 
  listing of components is simply a human readable reminder to readers 
  of the order of components for the specified type.
