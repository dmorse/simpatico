---------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan:

 1) McMd ConfigIo for configuration format      (SpcConfigIo)
 2) Add simple species to DdMd::Simulation
 3) DdMd ConfigIo for configuration format      (SpcConfigIo)
 4) McMd TrajectoryIo for trajectory format     (SptTrajectoryIo)
 5) DdMd Writer for trajectory format           (SptTrajectoryWriter)
 6) Tools reader                                (SptTrajectoryReader)
 7) Allow optional arguments in command lines
 8) Divide readers and writers for McMd

Progress (from reading source code on June 10, 2020, after long break)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Species classes have been moved to simp namespace

The Simp::Species class has functions writeStructure and readStructure
that allow output and input in a format intended for use in config 
files (and possibly trajectory files), in addition to different formats 
used in a parameter file. The matchStructure(std::istream&) function 
also allows comparison of a description in a config file with a 
pre-existing description from a parameter file

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Class McMd::SmpConfigio 

This class reads and writes a slight variant of spc config file format 
described in the the file config. The output file format contains both 
species and atom information. On input, when SPECIES is present, the
code validates consistency of species information with that given in 
the parameter file on input, using the Simp::Species::matchStructure 
function.  It currently requires that the atoms be output in sequential 
atom id order ("ordered" flag)

Possible further changes:

   - Change atom format string order from current itmpvs to the
     proposed imtpvs in both McMd::SimpConfigIo and DdMd class.
   - Allow reading of unordered atoms (not yet possible)
   - Consider changing class name from SmpConfigIo to SpcConfigIo
   - Change mcSim reading to allow reading a format with no velocities.
   - Allowing mcSim to write a format with no velocities

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Class DdMd::SmpConfigIo.

This class can also write read and write the new spc config file format. 

function DdMd::SmpConfigIo::readConfig(std::ifstream&, MaskPolicy) 

  On reading the SPECIES block is optional - if present the nSpecies
  value is broadcast and set on all processors by the function
  Simulation::setNSpecies. I assume that this sets the isMolecular 
  flag, but I need to check this.  Simp::Species::readStructure is
  used to read Species objects internal state. Species information 
  is stored only on the master node and not replicated.
  
  ATOM block currently requires "itpv" flags. The molecule "m" flag
  must match the value of Atom::hasAtomContext (Question: Is this set
  in the parameter file?).
  
  Treatment of groups depends on whether a SPECIES block exists:
  
     - If a SPECIES block is present, groups are generated by calling
       the makeBonds, makeAngles and makeDihedrals functions of this
       class.
  
     - If a SPECIES block is absent, the function looks for explicit
       BOND, ANGLE and DIHEDRAL blocks containing any groups. These
       blocks are all optional - absence implies absence of the 
       corresponding type of group.

  TODO:

    - Can we validate atom context info on input?
    - Retest things (any previous testing is forgotten)

function DdMd::SmpConfigIo::writeConfig(std::ifstream& ) 

  SPECIES block info is written iff available on master node.

  ATOMS block: 
      Output is current NOT ordered (cannot be read by mdSim and mcSim)
      atom context is written if available.
  
  Explicit group blocks are written iff SPECIES info is absent.
