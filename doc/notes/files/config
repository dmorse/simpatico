---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blocks in configuration file:

BOUNDARY:

   [Boundary]

ATOMS: 

   [molecular
    nSpecies int
    for each species {
       id  nMolecule  nAtom
    }
   ]
   [ordered]
   nAtom integer
   format [i][m][t]p[v][s][c]

   Format flags:
   i = global id (tag)                   only required for DdMd
   m = context (species, molecule, atom) only required for DdMd
   t = type id                           only required for DdMd
   p = position                          always required
   v = velocity                          required by MD simulations
   s = shift                             optional for MD simulations
   c = charge                            (possibility, for future)

   Comments:

   1) The molecular and ordered flags are optional, and are set 
   false by default.

   2) The presence of the molecular block indicates that atom ids 
   are in molecular order, consecutive within each molecule, 
   molecules of the same species consecutive within a block.

   3) The ddSim program will write the molecular block if the input 
   configuration was read from a file that contained it. It will 
   thus preserve and output molecular ordering, if it can.

   4) The default output formats for different simulation programs:

   Each program outputs as much information as it can
   mcSim and mdSim will each output in molecular format
   mcSim and mdSim will output groups by default, but not read them
   mdSim will output positions and velocities, shifts if possible
   ddSim will read and write molecule block specifications

BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS:
   
   [molecular
    nSpecies int
    for each species {
       id  nMolecule  nGroup
    }
   ]
   [ordered]
   nGroup  int
   For each {
      groupId atomId0 ... atomId(N-1) typeId
   }

   Remarks:

   1) The format is essentially the same for each type of covalent 
   bond, except for the block label BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS.

   2) The meaning of the optional molecular block and optional ordered
   flag are similar to those for atoms.

   3) If the block is molecular, the reading program can check that 
   atoms are all in the same molecule.
