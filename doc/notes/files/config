SIMPATICO CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

Configuration file extension:  *.smc

This is an ascii file format that is designed to be used as the initial
configuration for starting any Simpatico simulation. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
High level file structure (ascii):

   [SPECIES]
   BOUNDARY (same as current)
   ATOMS - format variable, indicated within block
   [BONDS] 
   [ANGLES] 
   [DIHEDRALS]

Comments:

1) The SPECIES section is optional. Its presence indicates that
the system is molecular.

2) The BONDS, ANGLES, DIHEDRALS sections are each optional. These
groups should normally be absent in a molecular system with a 
SPECIES block. They are used in a non-molecular system to list 
all covalent groups. They can be used in a molecular system to 
list additional covalent groups not listed in the SPECIES section 
(e.g., inter-molecular crosslinks).

3) The single processor mdSim and mcSim programs will normally write
config files in molecular format, with a SPECIES block, and no BOND,
ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS blocks. They will also only read files with this 
format. 

4) The parallel ddSim program will read files in either molecular or
non-molecular format, and will preserve all information present in a
molecular input file, so that it can be written back to file. If 
a SPECIES block is present, that will be used to generate Group
objects for all molecules, to be broadcast to all processors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIES:

   nSpecies int
   [hasAtomCharge]

   species 0
     nMolecule int
     nAtom int
     0 atomType [charge]
     1 atomType [charge]
       ...
     [nBond int]
     id  atomId0 atomId1 typeId
       .....
     [nAngle int]
     id  atomId0 atomId1 atomId2 typeId
       ...
     [nDihedral int]
     id  atomId0 atomId1 atomId2 typeId
     ...

   species 1 
     ....

   ------------------

   Comments: 
   
   1) This section is optional. Its appearance is a declaration that 
   the system is molecular. This means that if this section appears,
   the ids of atoms in the ATOMS section must be in molecular order, 
   and that bonded groups that are declared in this section should 
   not appear in separate BOND, ANGLE, or DIHEDRAL sections.

   2) The mcSim and mdSim programs will always output in molecular 
   format, and thus always output a SPECIES block.

   3) The ddSim program will output in molecular format if the input 
   file was in molecular format. The program needs an isMolecular 
   variable to preserve this information.

   4) The mcSim and mdSim programs may check information in the SPECIES
   block with information in the parameter file for consistency (but 
   this choice is not part of the file format definition).

   5) ddSim must be able to read a SPECIES block, and will replicate all 
   groups (bonds, angles, etc.) to create corresponding group objects for
   every molecule in each species. 

   6) If the SPECIES block is present, for a purely molecular system,
   corresponding BONDS, ANGLES, DIHEDRALS groups should not be present, 
   since this information would be redundant. 

   7) The BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS sections are always optional. The 
   absence of such a section indicates that there is no such block. If
   there is also no SPECIES block, absence of such a group section implies
   that there are no groups of the specified type. The Parameters nBond, 
   nAngle, nDihedral must be present if the labels are present, and must 
   be assigned a non-negative value, but may be assigned a zero value.
   Lines describing individual groups must be present iff nBond > 0, etc. 

BOUNDARY:

   [Boundary]

   Remark: This can use the existing file format, which is defined by
   the Boundary class.

ATOMS:

   [ordered]
   nAtom integer
   format [i][m][t]p[v][s][c]
   For each atom {
     [id][context][type][position][velocity][shift][charge]
   }

   Format flags:
   i = global id (tag)                     always include
   m = context (species, molecule, atom)   meaningful iff molecular
   t = type id                             required if not molecular
   p = position                            always required
   v = velocity                            required by MD simulations
   s = shift                               optional for MD simulations
   c = charge                              (possibility, for future)

   Comments:

   1) If a SPECIES block exists before the ATOM block, this declares that 
   atom ids are in molecular order, consecutive within each molecule, with 
   molecules of the same species consecutive within a block. This 
   precondition should be tested.

   2) The ordered flag is optional, and is assumed false if absent, and
   true if and only if present.

   3) All programs (mcSim, mdSim, ddSim an ppMd) should eventually be able 
   to handle either ordered or unordered files.

   4) If information that is input here repeats information given in the 
   SPECIES section, priority is given to the per atom data given here.
   This allows, for example, atom types to be set to values different 
   from those implied by the species definition.

   5) By default, all programs should output atom ids for readability
  
   6) By default, if molecular, programs should output context for readability.

   7) Molecular dynamics programs (mdSim and ddSim) will outut velocities,
   and shifts if possible.
   
   8) Initially, mcSim and mdSim should both output in the format "imtpv". 
   After both MD programs are taught to set velocities to zero when the "v"
   flag is absent, we could consider allowing mcSim to output in a format 
   with no velocities.
 
BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS:
   
   [ordered]
   nGroup  int
   For each {
      groupId atomId0 ... atomId(N-1) typeId
   }

   Remarks:

   1) In a molecular system with no inter-molecular bonding, the BONDS,
   ANGLES and DIHEDRALS blocks should be absent.

   2) In a molecular system, these blocks may be used to describe covalent
   interactions that are not already specified by the topology block. 

   3) Each of these blocks is optional. In a non-molecular system, the 
   absence of such  block means that there are no groups of the specified 
   type. In a molecular system, the absence of a block means that all such
   groups are accounted for by the SPECIES block.

   4) The format is essentially the same for each type of covalent bond, 
   except for the block label BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS and the number
   of atom ids.

   5) The meaning of the optional ordered flag is similar to that for atoms.
