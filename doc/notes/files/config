SIMPATICO CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

Configuration file extension:  *.smc

This is an ascii file format that is designed to be used as the initial
configuration for starting any Simpatico simulation. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
High level file structure (ascii):

   BOUNDARY (same as current)
   [SPECIES]
   ATOMS - format variable, indicated within block
   [TOPOLOGY] 
   [BONDS] 
   [ANGLES] 
   [DIHEDRALS]

Comments:

1) The SPECIES and TOPOLOGY sections must both be present or both
be absent. Their presence indicates that the system is molecular.

2) The BONDS, ANGLES, DIHEDRALS sections are each optional. These
groups should normally be absent in a molecular system. They are 
used in a non-molecular system to list all covalent groups, and 
can be used in a molecular system to list additional covalent groups 
(e.g., inter-molecular crosslinks).

3) The single processor mdSim and mcSim programs will normally write
config files in molecular format, with a SPECIES and TOPOLOGY block.
They will also only read files with this format.

4) The parallel ddSim program will read files in either molecular or
non-molecular format, and will preserve all information present in a
molecular input file, so that it can be written back to file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
BOUNDARY:

   [Boundary]

   Remark: This can use the existing file format, which is defiend by
   the Boundary class.

SPECIES:

   nSpecies int
   format t[c]

   species 1 {
      nMolecule int
      nAtom int
      0 type
      1 type
      ...
   }

   ------------------

   Format flags (i.e., allowed characters in format string):
      t = atom type
      c = charge

   Comments: 
   
   1) This section is optional. Its appearance is a declaration that 
   the system is molecular. This means that the ATOMS section must be 
   in molecular order, and a topology section must follow.

   2) The mcSim and mdSim programs will always output in molecular format, 
   and thus always output a SPECIES block.

   3) The ddSim program will output in molecular format if the input file 
   was in molecular format. The program needs an isMolecular variable to
   preserve this information.

   4) The mcSim and mdSim programs should validate type information in this 
   block against that given in their parameter files.

ATOMS:

   [ordered]
   nAtom integer
   format [i][m][t]p[v][s][c]
   For each atom {
     [id][context][type][position][velocity][shift][charge]
   }

   Format flags:
   i = global id (tag)                     always include
   m = context (species, molecule, atom)   meaningful iff molecular
   t = type id                             required if not molecular
   p = position                            always required
   v = velocity                            required by MD simulations
   s = shift                               optional for MD simulations
   c = charge                              (possibility, for future)

   Comments:

   1) The presence of a SPECIES block before the atom block indicates that 
   atom ids are in molecular order, consecutive within each molecule, with 
   molecules of the same species consecutive within a block. This 
   precondition should be tested.

   2) The ordered flag is optional, and is true if present, false if absent.

   3) All programs (mcSim, mdSim, ddSim an ppMd) should be able to handle 
   either ordered or unordered files.

   4) If information that is input here repeats information given in the 
   SPECIES section, priority is given to the per atom data given here.

   5) By default, all programs should output atom ids for readability
  
   6) By default, if molecular, programs should output context for readability
 
   7) Molecular dynamics programs (mdSim and ddSim) will outut velocities,
   and shifts if possible.
   
TOPOLOGY

   [hasBonds]
   [hasAngles]
   [hasDihedrals]

   Species 1 {
     nBond int
     id  type atomId0 atomId1
      .....
     nAngle int
     id  type atomId0 atomId1 atomId2
     ...
     nDihedral int
     id  type atomId0 atomId1 atomId2
     ...
   }

   Species 2 {
     ...
   }

   Comments:
   
   1) This block must be present if and only if a SPECIES block is present

   2) If this block is present, corresponding BONDS, ANGLES, DIHEDRALS groups 
   should not be present, since this information would be redundant.

   3) hasBonds, hasAngles, and hasDihedrals blocks are optional arguments 
   that are false if absent, and true if present

   4) Values of nBond, nAngle, nDihedral are must be present if and only 
   [hasBonds], [hasAngles], or [hasDihedrals] is set, respectively. Lines
   describing individual bonds must be present if nBond > 0, etc. 

   5) ddSim must be able to read a TOPOLOGY block, and will replicate all 
   groups (bonds, angles, etc.) to create corresponding group objects for
   every molecule in each species. 

   6) The mcSim and mdSim programs can ignore the topology block or cross 
   check for consistency, since equivalent information is in the parameter 
   file. (This choice is not part of the file format definition).

   7) Note that inclusion of compact topology information in the config 
   file makes it unnecssary to define a separate topology file format. The 
   mdPp postprocessor can process a trajectory by reading a config file 
   and a trajectory file, using the config file for topological information.

BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS:
   
   [ordered]
   nGroup  int
   For each {
      groupId atomId0 ... atomId(N-1) typeId
   }

   Remarks:

   1) In a molecular system with no intramolecular bonding, the BONDS,
   ANGLES and DIHEDRALS blocks should be absent.

   2) In a molecular system, these blocks may be used to describe covalent
   interactions that are not already specified by the topology block. 

   3) Each of these blocks is optional. In a non-molecular system, the 
   absence of sucha  block means that there are no groups of the specified 
   type. In a molecular system, the absence of a block means that all such
   groups are accounted for by the TOPOLOGY block.

   4) The format is essentially the same for each type of covalent bond, 
   except for the block label BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS and the number
   of atom ids.

   5) The meaning of the optional ordered flag is similar to that for atoms.
