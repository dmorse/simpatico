What to sort, and when

  -------------------------------------------------------------

  Proposal 1) Sort all local and ghost atoms, after they all
  exist. 

  When: This could be done immediately after exchange. 

  Pro: Comparatively simple to program, separate from exchange.

  Con: The sorting of ghost atoms is pointless, since new
  memory addresses will be chosen during the next exchange.

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Proposal 2) Only sort local atoms.

  When: This would have to be done after private exchangeAtoms
  and before exchangeGhosts.

  Pro: Avoid pointless sorting of ghost atoms.

  Con: Requires careful integration with exchange operation.
  The communication plans calculated during exchangeAtoms would
  remain valid, and could be copied to new locations. The 
  pointers to local atoms added to the sendArray would, however,
  be invalidated by the sort. This is the main problem.

  Conclusion: No immediate solution. More thought required.

Algorithm (outline)

   - Proposed functions for AtomArray:

        void addGroupExchanger(GroupExchanger& exchanger);

        void AtomArray::sort(Array<Atom*>& sequence, 
                             AtomStorage& atomStorage);

        The sequence would be an array of pointers to local atoms
        in the desired order.

   - Copy all local atom data to new arrays, from bottom. 

   - Copy all ghost atom data to new arrays, from top. Since the
     sequence is less important, this can use the list of ghost
     atoms from the AtomStorage, and fill the new array starting 
     from the top.

   - Swap array addresses.

   - Clear all local and ghost atoms from the AtomStorage.
     Add clearAll(AtomArray& method) ?

   - Add new local addresses to AtomStorage, adding sequentially 
     from the bottom of the AtomArray.

   - Add new ghost addresses to AtomStorage, adding sequentially 
     from the bottom of the AtomArray.

   - For each registered GroupExchanger, reset all Atom* pointers 
     in groups.
