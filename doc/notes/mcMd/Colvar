Classes

Proposed Classes:
-----------------

Collective Variables:
class ColVar              collective variable for hybrid (no derivatives)
class MdColVar            collective variable for md (with addForces)

Bias Functions:
class CvFunction          colvar bias potential, with 1D derivatives
class CvIdentityFunction  bias potential = collective variable
class CvLinearFunction  bias potential = collective variable
class CvHarmonicFunction  harmonic (umbrella sampling) cv potential
class CvGridPotential     potential defined on a grid

Question: Rename CvFunction as BiasFunction ?

Open Design Questions:

>> Biased MD simulations:
   Md simulations biased by a function of a collective variable.
   These include adapative algorithms such as metadynamics.

   Option 1: 
   Implement the bias potential as a "special" potential.  
   Questions: 
        1) How do implement the adaptation procedure?
            Option: As part of addForces() function ?
            Option: Add new function to SpecialPotential for this purpose ?
        2) How do we implement accumulation of statistics ?
            Option: Part of addForces() ?
            Option: Add new function to SpecialPotential for this purpose ?
   Proposal:
        Add a SpecialPotential base class that has a separate analyize()
        function with an internally defined interval. Default implementation 
        does nothing. Modify MD loop to call this every time step, but set
        actions and schedule internally.
   
   Option 2:
   Implement the bias potential via a separate command. 
   Questions:  
        1) What object owns the required potential energy class?
        2) How do we make sure the forces are applied ?
        3) How do we implement adaptation of the bias ?

   Current Preference: Option 1 with an enlarged interface for SpecialPotential.

>> Hybrid MD/MC simulations

   Simulations in which short MD simulations are used as proposed moves. 

   Comment: The main loop for this is different than for a conventional MD
   simulation, so its hard to implement in an MD framework. The inner loop
   is, however, the same as an MD simulation, so it makes sense to implement
   this within the framework of an MdSimulation.

   Option: Implement as a new command in an MdSimulation, which implements 
   Metropolis acceptance / rejection.

   Questions:

       1) What object owns the required ColVar and Bias classes ?
          Proposal: The HybridColVarSimulationCommand object ?
       2) Where is adaptation implemented ? (same, in the command ?)
          Proposal: Also in the command class.

   Comment: It should be possible to define the Hybrid MD algorithm as a 
   base class or template. The basic command for this just requires some
   sort of bias or potential energy class that can evaluate a function of 
   a collective variable, without requiring either an addForces or an 
   atomEnergy function. What class should we use for this bias? If we
   use a template, what interface should we require?

   Proposal: Use a template, which takes a potential energy as a template
   parameter, and calls the computeEnergy() function.  This would allow 
   the use of any of the existing potential energies, including special
   potentials, as bias potentials. 

   Question: Should the algorithm for hybrid MD simulations include
   function calls intended to allow for adaptation?

   Proposal: At least initially, no. Perhaps make a separate command
   with adaptation, to allow use of a special potential in which we
   call the SpecialPotential::analyze() function.

Proposed Class Interfaces:

class ColVar {
   void compute() = 0;
   void unset();
   double value();
   bool isSet() const;
}

class MdColvar : public Colvar {
   void addForces(double dPotentialdCv);
}

class CvPotential {
   double value(double colvar);
   double derivative(double colvar);
}
