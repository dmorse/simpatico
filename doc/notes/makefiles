Simpatico root directory:

setup          - rename current configure script.
configure      - reset options programmatically.
makefile       - Recursively descent src. Separate targets for html and tests.

src/
  makefile     -> Includes compiler.mk, config and patterns from all subdirectories
               -> Define executable names, including util and mcmd suffixes.
                  Recursively descends into subdirectories
  configure    -> reset options programmatically.
src/
  makefile     -> Includes make/global.mk
make/
  README       -> explain what the other files are.
  global.mk    -> Defines directories (ROOT, SRC, BUILD, BIN) (modifiable)
                  Define CXX_SERIAL, CXX_MPI
                  Define MAKEDEP
                  Define standard macros (SHELL, AR, etc.)
                  Include compiler files
  gcc.mk       -> gnu compiler   (modifiable)
  intel.mk     -> intel compiler (modifiable)

util/
  config.mk    -> Initializes and appends to UTIL_DEFINE and UTIL_SUFFIX.
                  Define library name, using only util suffixes.
                  Defines CXX as CXX_SERIAL or CXX_MPI, depending on UTIL_MPI
  patterns.mk  -> Adds util/config.mk as dependencies for all targets.
  sources.mk   -> List of source files.
  makefile     -> Includes global.h, config, patterns, sources
               -> Other makefiles include src/compiler.mk, src/util/config.mk

mcMd/
  config.mk    -> Includes util/config.mk
                  Initializes MCMD_DEFINE = UTIL_DEFINE and 
                              MCMD_SUFFIX = UTIL_SUFFIX
                  Define library name, using util and mcMd suffixes.
  patterns.mk  -> Includes src/make/compiler.mk and src/mcmd/config.mk
               -> Adds util/config.mk and mcMd/config.mk as dependencies.
